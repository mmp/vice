            <section class="docs-intro">
              <p><i>vice</i> is an air traffic control simulator, focused on TRACON.
                It presents a STARS-like interface, but with simulated traffic and other controllers.
                It also supports multiple users, where each person controls a different position at a facility.
              </p>
              <p><i>vice</i> supports departure and arrival control
                scenarios in a number of TRACONs:
                A80 (ATL),
                A90 (BOS),
                C90 (ORD, MDW),
                D01 (DEN, GJT),
                D10 (DFW),
                F11 (JAX, MCO, SFB, ISM, ORL),
                L30 (LAS),
                M98 (MSP),
                N90 (EWR, JFK, LGA, FRG, ISP, HVN),
                NCT (SJC, SFO, OAK, RNO, SMF, MRY, MER, MOD, SCK, SAC, LVK, SNS),
                P50 (PHX),
                S46 (SEA),
                SCT (BUR, LAX, LGB, ONT, PSP, SAN, SNA, VNY, WHP),
                Y90 (BDL),
                as well as the
                AAC, ABE, ASE, AUS, BHM, CLE, CLT, COS, CYS, DAB, DCA, GSP, IND, JAX, MIA, MKE, PHL, SAV, SDF, and TPA
                ATCT/TRACONs.
                New scenarios are regularly added.
                Adding scenarios at additional airports is a matter of writing JSON configuration files that describe them;
                see <a href="#section-facility-engineering">below</a> for documentation about how scenarios are described
                and please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/y993vgQxhY"><i>vice</i> discord</a> if you'd like to contribute!
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/MNFpFaT1k7s">video overview</a> that gives a tour of
                <i>vice</i>. (Note: this video was recorded with an older version of <i>vice</i>, so some details are
                different in the latest version.)
              </p>
            </section><!--//docs-intro-->
          </header>

          <section class="docs-section" id="started">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The radar client interface that <i>vice</i> provides is based on STARS.
              For familiarity to VATSIM controllers, <i>vice</i> generally follows the keyboard command scheme
              implemented
              in <a href="https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/">CRC's STARS implementation</a>; see
              the discussion of <a href="#section-stars"><i>vice</i>'s STARS
              emulation</a> below for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time you launch <i>vice</i>, a window is shown for configuring the simulation.
              (After the first time, the window can be brought up by clicking the "replay" button in the menubar: <i
                class="fas fa-redo"></i>.)
              A number of scenarios are available, some departure-only and
              some including both departures and arrivals.
              Here is an example:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config.png" srcset="config-2x.png 2x" width="619" height="668" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After selecting an ARTCC, the available TRACONs and ATCT/TRACONs in that ARTCC are shown.
              Selecting one of those gives a number of scenarios to choose from. Here the ZNY ARTCC has
              been selected and then the PHL ATCT/TRACON. After choosing a scenario and clicking the "Next"
              button, a window with further settings is shown:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config-rates.png" srcset="config-rates-2x.png 2x" width="518" height="485" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration rates dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              In the second configuration window, you can set the average departure rate (ADR)
              for all of the airports that may have departures in the scenario as well as the average arrival rate (AAR) for all of the
              arrival airports.
              (The PHL scenario only includes the Philadelphia Airport, though other scenarios include both a primary airport as well as satellites.)
              Both of these rates are specified in terms of aircraft per hour, so an ADR of 30 corresponds to one aircraft departing
              every two minutes (on average).
              If you'd like an arrival-only scenario, for example, just set all of the departure rates to zero.
            </p>
            <p>
              The "Sequencing challenge" slider controls how challenging the departure sequence is&mdash;the higher it
              is, the more likely it is
              that successive departures will be to the same gate or to the same fix.
              For arrivals, the "Go around probability" slider allows setting the probability that each arrival goes around.
              You may also select "Include random arrival pushes", which will periodically bump up the rate of
              arrivals to increase the challenge of vectoring the aircraft.
              "Push frequency" sets how often arrival pushes happen and "Length of push" sets how long they last
              before traffic returns to regular levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you have configured the simulation, click "Ok" and you will have a STARS scope and flight strip
              window to work with.
              Use the usual STARS commands as appropriate (to initiate track, accept handoffs, handoff to other
              controllers, etc.),
              and the additional <a href="#commands">ATC commands below</a> to issue control commands to aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the simulation starts, <i>vice</i> also displays a small
              window listing the active departures, arrivals, and approaches.
              For this LGA scenario, three arrivals are active but there is
              just one approach and one departure.
              Other scenarios may be more complex.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="approaches.png" srcset="approaches-2x.png 2x" width="439" height="435" class="img-fluid" alt="approach list">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              The approach codes&mdash;here, "27R" and "35"&mdash; are used in <i>vice</i>'s aircraft control commands like "expect approach"
              and "cleared approach".
            </p>
            <p>To free up space, you can close this window by clicking on the "X" in the upper right corner.
              Clicking on the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button in the menubar will show
              the window again.
            </p>
            <p>To adjust the amount of space used for flight strips, right click the line separating the flight strips
              from the
              radar window and drag left or right with your mouse.
              You can also remove flight strips entirely by opening the settings window, <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> in the menubar, and disabling "Show flight strips" under the "Flight strips" header.

              When you exit <i>vice</i>, it remembers everything going on&mdash;all of the aircraft in flight, the
              instructions they have been given, etc.
              The next time you launch <i>vice</i>, it loads all of that back in and you can continue where you left
              off.
              If you'd like to start something new, just click <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> and configure a new
              simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <i>vice</i> is paused, you can hover the mouse above a radar track to see information about the
              instructions the aircraft has been given so far&mdash;for example, altitude and speed assignments, whether
              it has been sent direct to a fix, the approach it has been assigned, etc. An example is shown below. This
              information is especially useful when resuming a <i>vice</i> session after you have been away from it for
              a while.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Drawing Routes</h2>
            <p><i>vice</i> can draw the active departures, approaches, and
              arrivals for the current simulation. This can be helpful when
              studying those for an airport, since they are drawn directly on
              the radar scope with annotations that give the fixes, any
              altitude or speed restrictions, and procedure turns.
            </p>
            <p>To toggle whether a route is drawn on the scope, click the checkbox on the left
              next to it in the information window that is shown at

            <h2 class="section-heading">Launching Aircraft</h2>
            <p>When a new simulation starts, <i>vice</i> automatically launches new departures and arrivals based on the
              departure and arrival rates set in the "New Simulation" window.
              During a simulation, clicking on the departing plane icon in the menubar <i
                class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>
              opens a window that allows more control over aircraft launches.
              (Note that when <i>vice</i> is used with multiple controllers in the same simulation, only one controller
              may have this window open at a time.)
            </p>
            <p>The rates for automatic launches can be adjusted in this window. Alternatively, aircraft can be launched
              manually. If manual launches are selected,
              the window shows all of the available departure runways and exits as
              well as all of the arrivals, as shown below. Clicking the aircraft icon for a departure or arrival
              causes the aircraft shown to be launched. If you'd like a different aircraft for the
              next launch (for example, to have a heavy aircraft), click the redo icon <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> until
              you're happy with the selection.
              The window also shows the elapsed time since the launch of each type as well as how many
              miles in trail (MIT) there would be if the next aircraft was launched.
              To delete all of the aircraft from the simulation and restart, click the trash icon:

              Select "Create multi-controller" in the "New Simulation" window and
              you can select an ARTCC, ATCT/TRACON, and scenario in the same way
              that you do with a single controller.
              For multi-controller scenarios, there are some additional settings, shown beneath

            <br>
            <p>
              Each multi-controller simulation has a name associated with it;
              <i>vice</i> chooses a random one by default (above, it's "choice-length").
              You're welcome to choose a different name if you prefer.
              These names can be used so that you can tell other people which
              simulation to choose in order to join you.
              You may also enable "Require password" and enter a password for the
              simulation so that only people you allow can join it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selecting "Join multi-controller" shows a list of the simulations
              that are currently available, including how many controllers
              are signed into each one.
              Note that the simulation names are shown in the first column.
              After selecting one, you can choose one of the available control
              positions and join.
              <i>vice</i> also allows you to join a simulation as an observer,
              in which case you have no control capabilities.

            <p>The commands below issue control commands to aircraft. To
              indicate which aircraft should be given a command, you
              can either enter a command and click on an aircraft's radar
              track or you can enter the aircraft's callsign, a space,
              the command, and then press the "enter" key.
              After you issue a command, the virtual pilot's readback is shown at the bottom of the window.
              The aircraft will then start following that instruction, to the best of its abilities.
              Unlike VATSIM, the pilots will always do exactly what you tell them to.

            <p>If you'd like to issue multiple commands to an aircraft,
              enter the commands one after another with a space between them and

            <p>
              <i>vice</i> is able to indicate when aircraft are outside of the departure or approach airspace,
              if it has information about the airspace boundaries.
              (This information is not available at all airports.)
              If an aircraft is outside of its assigned airspace, a red "AS" error will be printed at the
              top of its datablock, as shown below.
              The valid altitudes for the aircraft are shown as well, if there are any valid altitudes
              at its current location.
              For example, the aircraft below is at 5,000' but should be between 10,000' and 12,000' (or should be at a
              different location!)

            <p>
              Two commands are available to draw the boundaries and altitude ranges of the departure and approach
              airspace.
              (Note that the placement of the drawn altitude labels is not always ideal.)

            <h2 class="section-heading">Release History</h2>

            <h3>0.10.21 (TODO March 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>New scenarios: BDL (MerryArbitrary), M98 (Jace Martin).</li>
              <li>Scenario updates: EWR (aq86_), LGA (Yi Zheng), MIA (Connor Allen), Y90 (MerryArbitrary, Nelson T).</li>
              <li>STARS simulation has been improved in numerous ways:
                <ul>
                  <li>Significantly improved how handoffs are handled: multiple redirected handoffs are now supported, inter- and intra-facility handoffs are now handled more accurately.</li>
                  <li>Added support for "force quicklook" to push a quicklook to another controller.</li>
                  <li>Added support for minimum safe altitude warnings (MSAW) for aircraft that are below the MVA.</li>
                  <li>CWT category updates and bugfixes.</li>
                  <li>Added support for global leader lines.</li>
                  <li>Limited datablocks are now supported (and used when appropriate).</li>
                  <li>Added point out history command.</li>
                  <li>Fixed various bugs in DCB spinners (brightness now goes in steps of 5, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where leader lines would be drawn over track symbols.</li>
                  <li>Handle various cases where the FDB should be displayed by default.</li>
                  <li>The scratchpad can now be set by entering text and slewing an aircraft.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A number of other bug fixes, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where go-arounds would sometimes not contact departure.</li>
                  <li>Fixed bugs in the winds display in the "new sim" user interface.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where departures handed off to virtual controllers wouldn't climb to their final altitude.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>In scenario groups, "tracon" must be a valid 3-letter id from the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/air_traffic_services/tracon">FAA list of TRACONs</a>. (This allows <i>vice</i> to present scenarios grouped by ARTCC and then TRACON.)</li>
                  <li><i>vice</i> now has a built-in model of magnetic declination. Therefore, the "magnetic_variation" setting is no longer used. If small adjustments are needed (e.g. due to video maps assuming a different magnetic adjustment, "magnetic_correction" can be used to add a small offset to the automatically-determined value.</li>
                  <li>There is a new "stars_config" field in scenario definitions with a number of new fields to define per-facility STARS behavior. (See the <a href="#fe-stars-videomaps">STARS and Video Maps</a> section for details.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.20 (28 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added new scenarios: SCT LAX (Jud Lopez), IND (Samuel Valencia), MKE (Yahya Nazimuddin), MIA (Mike K).
              </li>
              <li>Scenario updates/bugfixes: TPA (Connor Allen), SCT ONT/SNA (Eli Thompson), A80, L30 (Michael Trokel).
              </li>
              <li>STARS: added automated terminal proximity alert (ATPA) support.</li>
              <li>STARS: consolidated wake turbulence (CWT) categories are now shown in datablocks and used for ATPA
                in-trail requirements.</li>
              <li>Live weather can now be used in sims.</li>
              <li>STARS: fixed various small bugs related to when the FDB should be displayed.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>For arrivals, the runway endpoint no longer needs to be included in the route.</li>
                  <li>For departures, the runway start and endpoints no longer need to be included in the route.</li>
                  <li>In STARs, "runway_waypoints" are now specified separately per-airport.</li>
                  <li>Improved support for multi-runway departure scenarios: it is no longer required that each runway
                    have a route for each exit;
                    now it is just required that between all of the active runways at an airport, one of them must have
                    a route for each exit.</li>
                  <li><i>vice</i> is now able to extract STARs and arrival routes from the FAA
                    <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/">Coded
                      Instrument Flight Procedures (CIFP)</a>.
                    These can be incorporated in scenario definitions, simplifying the development of new scenarios.
                  <li>"location" no longer needs to be specified for airports.</li>
                  <li>Waypoints at the thresholds of all runways are now built-in: for example, <code>KJFK-4L</code>
                    gives the threshold
                    of runway 4L at JFK.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.19 (13 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>STARS: fixed bug with flickering airport weather list.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.18 (12 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added new scenarios: SCT (Justin Nguyen and Eli Thompson), NCT and D01/GJT (Jud Lopez), and TPA
                (Connor Allen).</li>
              <li>Smaller scenario updates: D10 and JAX (Mike K), AUS (Jace Martin), LGA, JFK, COS, CLE, ASE, DCA, F11.
              </li>
              <li>STARS: more accurate simulation of the STARS weather radar display.</li>
              <li>Added new syntax for issuing left/right turn in degrees: <code>T10L</code>, <code>T20R</code>, etc.
              </li>
              <li>STARS: allow middle-click highlight of aircraft regardless of having their track.</li>
              <li>STARS: fix LDB/FRB/PRI/POS brightness usage when drawing things (hopefully).</li>
              <li>STARS: fixed bug where observers were unable to quicklook other positions.</li>
              <li>Fixed a few cases where <i>vice</i> would crash when given an invalid scenario.</li>
              <li>Improved calculation of the final approach course line, which fixed some bugs with bad approach
                intercepts.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>Arc routes between fixes can now be specified without specifying a center point for the arc's
                    circle:
                    for example, <code>WUPMA/arc7.5 ALABE</code> has aircraft fly along the 7.5nm long arc between WUPMA
                    and ALABE.</li>
                  <li>The "tower_list" property of airports is now used to prioritize tower list assignment rather than
                    used directly.
                    (Thus, if multiple airports have the same "tower_list" value, they no longer try to share the same
                    tower list.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.17 (15 January 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added multiple new scenarios: D10 (Mike K), CYS, ASE, COS (Jud Lopez).</li>
              <li>Fixed multiple bugs with handling of altitude and speed restrictions in departure routes.</li>
              <li>Many small fixes to scenario routes and altitude/speed restrictions.</li>
              <li>Increased acceleration and climb rate of departures to be more realistic.</li>
              <li>Fixed bugs with point outs (couldn't be cleared, incorrect rendering in STARS).</li>
              <li>Fixed bug in the STARS scope that required secondary scratchpads to be three characters.</li>
              <li>When departures are handed off to center, they are only given direct to the exit fix if
                they are on a heading; otherwise they continue flying their route.</li>
              <li>(Re-)added optional sound effect for accepted handoffs.</li>
              <li>Airspace warnings are inhibited for aircraft flying approaches.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where wind would affect aircraft on the ground and blow them off course.</li>
              <li>STARS: allow control-left-click in place of the third mouse button to highlight aircraft.</li>
              <li>STARS: don't allow scratchpads of arbitrary length.</li>
              <li>STARS: actually use the LDB brightness setting for limited/partial datablocks.</li>
              <li>STARS: fix incorrect error message after issuing "at fix, cleared approach".</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixes in routes may have <code>/flyover</code> after
                    them to indicate that aircraft must fly directly over the
                    fix before starting their next turn.</li>
                  <li>It is no longer required to specify radar sites in scenarios; if no sites are given,
                    then STARS Fused mode is always enabled.</li>
                  <li>Departure routes may be given with either "assigned_altitude" or "cleared_altitude".
                    "cleared_altitude" implies "climb via SID": aircraft obey altitude restrictions and
                    climb no higher than the given altitude, while "assigned_altitude" has them climb without
                    restriction to that altitude.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            <h3>0.10.16 (22 December 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added multiple new scenarios: S46, BHM, GSP (Aaron Flett), AUS (Jace Martin), P50 (Mike K)</li>
              <li>Multi-controller servers can now be password-protected</li>
              <li>Added "TO" command for "contact tower"</li>
              <li>Various bugfixes with handoffs and approach navigation</li>
              <li>Match real-world STARS alert sounds</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>The scenario group "nm_per_*" settings have been removed and no longer need to be specified.</li>
                  <li>Fixed crashes with the <code>-scenario</code>
                    and <code>-videomap</code> command-line options</li>
                  <li>It is no longer required to specify "full_name" for
                    approaches; a default name will be assigned using the
                    specified approach type and runway if "full_name" is not
                    given.</li>
                  <li>In "departure_routes", the "route" field has been
                    renamed to "sid". It is optional to specify "sid"; if the
                    aircraft isn't on a published departure it should be left blank.</li>
                  <li>In "arrivals", the "route" field has been renamed to "star".</li>
                  <li>Approaches now have a "tower_controller" field to specify which tower
                    controller arrivals should contact. If an airport has a single controller
                    named "(airport)_TWR", then "tower_controller" doesn't need to be specified.</li>
                  <li>Arrivals specified in "arrival_groups" now have an "assigned_altitude" field
                    (and "cleared_altitude" has been removed.) If "assigned_altitude" is specified,
                    it is treated as an altitude assignment from a previous controller and the
                    aircraft will not descend further. For aircraft on a STAR that have been cleared
                    to descend via the STAR, "assigned_altitude" should not be given.</li>
                  <li>For multi-controller scenarios, departure controllers can be specified per-runway
                    (e.g., "KPHX/25R") or per-SID (e.g., "KJFK/SCORR5").
                </ul>

            <h3>0.10.15 (19 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>STARS: fixed a bug where RBL lines for *T that included aircraft weren't drawn</li>
              <li>Added an option to hide the flight strips (Settings window, Flight Strips section)</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where inbound handoffs wouldn't send a radio contact message</li>
              <li>Sped up loading of video maps so that vice launches more
                quickly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.14 (18 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>L30 TRACON (Las Vegas) added, thanks to Michael Trokel.</li>
              <li>Added a combined N90 (JFK, LGA, EWR) scenario.</li>
              <li>Important readbacks from pilots (e.g., "unable") are now highlighted in red.</li>
              <li>Improved STARS *T to allow entering fix names and to show ETA.</li>
              <li>Added support for charted visual approaches.</li>
              <li>STARS allows control-shift click to initiate track (CRC style).</li>
              <li>Secondary scratchpads are now supported.</li>
              <li>Fixed bug that would cause arrivals to climb when vectored off of their STAR.</li>
              <li>Fixed other minor navigation bugs.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering:
                <ul>
                  <li>Scenarios can now have "center" and "range" specified; they override the scenario group valus, if
                    present.</li>
                  <li>"default_map" in scenarios is now "default_maps"; an array of values can be given, allowing
                    multiple maps to be initially shown.</li>
                  <li>Departures from different runways at an airport are sequenced better so that CAs on departure are
                    less likely.</li>
                  <li>Added "tracon" to the scenario group definition; this is used to gather scenarios for a single
                    TRACON in the UI.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.13 (5 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug that caused vice to sometimes crash after aircraft were given approach clearance.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where descending aircraft would stop descending when given approach clearance.</li>
              <li>Small fixes to the DCA scenario.</li>
              <li>Polished up handling of early hand-offs of departures in
                the STARS scope</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.12 (31 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added a new DCA scenario.</li>
              <li>Aircraft will now ident if given the "ID" command.</li>
              <li>There is now a short delay (3-6 seconds) before aircraft
                start following heading instructions, to better model reality.</li>
              <li>Control commands for aircraft can now be given without
                slewing on the aircraft: enter their callsign, a space, one
                or more commands, and then hit enter.</li>
              <li>Point outs can be rejected by entering "UN" and slewing
                on the radar track of an aircraft being pointed out.</li>
              <li>RNAV approaches can now be intercepted via a heading.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where departures wouldn't follow altitude
                restrictions on SIDs.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where aircraft that went around would
                always continue to do so on subsequent approaches.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering updates:
                <ul>
                  <li>The "multi_controllers" field in scenario definitions
                    is now an object where each entry specifies a control
                    position split. If more than one split is specified, then
                    the user will be prompted to pick one of them when
                    launching a scenario.</li>
                  <li>Also in "multi_controllers", a single departure
                    controller is no longer specified using the Boolean
                    "departure". Instead, there is a "departures" field that
                    is an array of strings specifying airports and/or runways
                    that a controller is responsible for.</li>
                  <li>Airports have an optional "name" field that is used
                    in transmissions from aircraft when referring to the airport.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.11 (10 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added the D01 (Denver TRACON) scenario to
                single-user <i>vice</i> (it was unintentionally not
                included in the installer).</li>
              <li>Added support for updating your Discord activity based on
                your <i>vice</i> session (thanks to Samuel Valencia!)</li>
              <li>Clicking the <i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> icon on the
                menubar opens a window that shows a summary
                of <i>vice</i>'s keyboard commands.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug with aircraft descending too early when flying procedure turns.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where some departures would try to re-fly
                their initial departure route after being handed off to a
                virtual controller.</li>
              <li>Fixed multiple bugs with the handling of "at or above" altitude constraints.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug that left the default DCB brightness set to
                0.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.10 (1 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug in the Windows installer that caused new
                scenarios (AAC, SAV, SDF) to not be installed locally.</li>
              <li>Added the ability to <a href="#draw-routes">draw active departure, arrival, and
                  approach routes on</a> the radar scope.
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering updates related to the above:
                <ul>
                  <li>When specifying fixes in approaches, you can
                    add <code>/iaf</code>, <code>/if</code>
                    and/or <code>/faf</code> to specify that a fix is the
                    initial approach fix, initial fix, or final approach
                    fix. This is then drawn on the scope when the approach is
                    shown but isn't used otherwise.
                  </li>
                  <li>For arrivals under "arrival_groups", there is an
                    optional string "description" field that will be shown in
                    the UI. Similarly, for departures in "departure_routes",
                    you can also give a "description" string.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.9 (28 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Many improvements to the AAC scenario's accuracy:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added turboprop and piston departures and arrivals for AAC.</li>
                  <li>AAC jet arrivals now come in on the TULSA4; turboprops
                    and pistons pass through their approach gate (at lower
                    altitudes) and are routed direct TUL.</li>
                  <li>AAC departures now follow headings after takeoff
                    (props 010 or 190, jets/turboprops 260/310, depending on
                    departure gate.)</li>
                  <li>Inbound handoffs are now 45 miles out.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals would sometimes climb after
                being cleared for the approach.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering: when exits are specified in
                "departure_routes", additional text can be included after a
                period. This text is ignored when determining which exit an
                aircraft uses. This can be useful if for example piston
                aircraft and jets have different departure procedures;
                "COLIN.P" and "COLIN.J" departure routes could be specified
                with the used for piston aircraft and the second used for jets.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.8 (26 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>When altitude and speed instructions are given, aircraft
                now do both at once. To give consecutive commands (e.g.,
                "descend and maintain xxx, then reduce speed to yyy"),
                there is now a <code>TS</code> command for "then speed",
                and <code>TA</code> for "then altitude", or <code>TC</code>
                for "then climb", or <code>TD</code> for "then descend".
                (See the <a href="#commands">ATC command reference</a> for
                details.)
              </li>
              <li>Updates to the JAX, C90, and F11 scenarios and a new
                D01/KSAV/KSDF scenario (Thanks to Mike D and Samuel
                Valencia!)</li>
              <li>Added a new scenario for KAAC/KJKE.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
                <ul>
                  <li>DME arcs can now be <a href="#fe-routes">specified with approaches</a>.</li>
                  <li>Scratchpads may be <a href="#fe-airports">specified
                      individually with departures</a>.</li>
                  <li>Fixes can now be specified with respect to a distance
                    along a radial from another fix.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Various small bugfixes related to aircraft navigation and
                clearing approaches at fixes.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.7 (8 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals would disappear in some
                scenarios (KJAX, KDAB, ...)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.6 (not released)</h3>

            <h3>0.10.5 (6 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added support for STARS fused mode (updates every second,
                round markers for radar tracks; choose "FUSED" in the "SITE menu.)
              <li>It is no longer allowed to issue control commands to
                departing aircraft before they have checked in.</li>
              <li>Added multiple new <a href="#commands">ATC commands</a>:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>EC</code>/<code>ED</code>: expedite
                    climb/descent.</li>
                  <li><code>I</code>: intercept the localizer (of the
                    approach previously given with "expect approach").</li>
                  <li><code>SMIN</code>: maintain slowest practical speed</li>
                  <li><code>SMAX</code>: maintain maximum forward speed</li>
                  <li><code>A</code><i>fix</i><code>/C</code><i>approach</i>:
                    at the specified fix, cleared for the given approach.</li>
                  <li>More flexible altitude crossing
                    restrictions<code>C</code><i>fix</i><code>/A100-</code> is cross <code>FIX</code> at or
                    below 10,000, <code>CFIX/A120-150</code> is

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Removed the "elevation" field for airports; it is no
                    longer needed.</li>
                  <li>Radars must have an "elevation" value specified, unless
                    their location is given using an ICAO airport code, in
                    which the airport's elevation is used.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Minor fixes to the ABE scenario.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.4 (16 August 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added support for STARS Converging Runways Display Aid (CRDA).</li>
              <li>Made multiple improvements to aircraft flight modeling,
                including more accurate climbs at departure and better
                handling of wind.</li>
              <li>Tuned up pilot radio communications, including adding
                initial contact messages.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where after quitting and later resuming a
                simulation, some aircraft would forget their routing.</li>
              <li>Added support for the STARS Maps system list.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added "reporting_points" to scenarios: fixes aircraft may use
                    when reporting their current position.</li>
                  <li>Added support for specifying volumes of space
                    where collision alerts are inhibited.</li>
                  <li>Altitude restrictions at fixes are now more flexible:
                    rather than just "at", they may be "between", "at or
                    above," or "at or below."</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.3 (1 August 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added "quick look" support to the STARS implementation.</li>
              <li>Added support for STARS dwell mode.</li>
              <li>Fixed a rare crash when manually adjusting launch rates.</li>
              <li>Various small improvements to the JAX and CLT scenario files.</li>
              <li>Many additional small cosmetic and functionality
                improvements to the STARS radar scope.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.2 (28 July 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added scenarios for the A80 (ATL) and A80 (BOS) TRACONs (thanks Mike K!).</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug with drawing *J cones in the STARS scope.</li>
              <li>Many improvements to the STARS DCB, including better
                rendering of the buttons, more support for configuring
                font size and brightness, as well as the ability to
                position the DCB on the top, bottom, left, or right
                edge of the screen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.1 (25 July 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Updated the font used in the STARS radar scope.</li>
              <li>Fixed a few bugs with drawing radar tracks in the
                STARS scope.</li>
              <li>Fixed a rare crash with incorrect command input to the STARS scope.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.0 (22 July 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Vice now supports multiple controllers working in the
                same simulation. In the "New Simulation" window, choose
                "Create multi-controller" to create a new simulation or
                "Join multi-controller" to join an existing one.
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Removed
                    "default_controller" and renamed "callsign" in
                    scenarios to "solo_controller". Scenarios now take an
                    optional "multi_controllers" object to specify a
                    multi-controller scenario. Added "full_name" to
                    controller specifications for better radio readback text.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Launches of arrivals and departures can be controlled
                manually; click on the departing aircraft icon <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i> in the
                menu bar to open a window with launch
                controls. Alternatively, launch rates can be controlled
                during a session via that same window.</li>
              <li>Various improvements to the accuracy of the STARS
                radar scope simulation.</li>
              <li>Available approaches are now shown by <i>vice</i> at initial
                connection time and via the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button
                in the menu bar.</li>
              <li>Many small bug fixes to aircraft flight modeling.</li>
              <li>New scenarios and improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added C90, including O'Hare East and West
                    ops, MDW all configs</li>
                  <li>Added CLE TRACON, including final, feeder, and
                    North/South scenarios</li>
                  <li>Added CLT TRACON, North and South configs</li>
                  <li>JAX: added DAB and the TEBOW1 arrival</li>
                  <li>N90: added multi-controller scenarios at JFK and PHL</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.9.2 (3 July 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed the behavior of *T to better match
                STARS: the line is now drawn to the mouse
                position after the first point is selected, without
                waiting for the second point.</li>
              <li>Added more checks when loading scenario descriptions;
                in particular, misspellings and unused JSON objects
                are detected and an error is issued. This led to
                numerous small fixes in all of the the scenarios.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.9.1 (20 June 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals wouldn't obey altitude
                restrictions in STARs(!).</li>
              <li>Improved navigation: crossing restrictions beyond any
                at the immediately upcoming fix are now
                considered. Aircraft are now much better at starting
                altitude and speed adjustments in time to meet the
                crossing restrictions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.9.0 (15 June 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>All new flight modeling engine supports procedure turns (both racetrack and standard 45/180)
                and more accurate turns to intercept localizers, etc. The approaches in the existing scenarios
                have been updated to include their procedure turns, where appropriate.</li>
              <li>A number of new <a href="#commands">aircraft control
                  commands</a> have been added:
                <ul>
                  <li>Cancel speed restrictions</li>
                  <li>Cleared straight in approach</li>
                  <li>Cross <i>fix</i> at <i>altitude</i> and <i>speed</i></li>
                  <li>Depart <i>fix</i> at <i>heading</i></li>
                  <li>Fly present heading</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>When a departure is handed off to a virtual controller, the other controller won't
                climb it further until after it is clicked by the user to acknowledge the handoff.</li>
              <li>Fixed very small fonts being used on Windows systems with high-DPI displays</li>
              <li>Numerous other small fixes and improvements, including in the wind modeling and fixing
                a case where arrivals would fly faster than the aircraft is capable.</li>
              <li><i>Facility engineering:</i> In addition to new directives to specify procedure turns,
                there are a number of changes to how <a href="#fe-routes">routes</a> are specified.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Earlier Releases</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>0.8.1: fixed a bug where the STARS window wouldn't show anything.</li>
              <li>0.8.0: When you quit vice, now it remembers all of the aircraft; when you launch it again, you can
                resume right where you left off.
                When the sim is paused, hovering the mouse on a radar track displays information about its routing and
                assignments.

          <section class="docs-section" id="stars-key-concepts">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Key Concepts</h2>

            <p>Aircraft are shown on the STARS scope as <i>radar tracks</i>;
              a <i>datablock</i> next to them shows the aircraft's callsign
              and additional information about it. A <i>leader line</i>
              connects the radar track to the datablock. Here is an example:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="example-track.png" srcset="example-track-2x.png 2x" width="195" height="72" class="img-fluid"
                alt="example aircraft track">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Here we see the aircraft's callsign, ELY115, its altitude in hundreds of feet (032), and its groundspeed
              in tens of knots (26). The "B" is the aircraft's consolidated wake turbulence category&mdash;upper heavy.
              (See the section on <a href="#tracks-datablocks">Tracks and Datablocks</a> for extensive documentation of
              datablocks and the information they may show.)</p>
            <p>The blue circle shows the aircraft's current position and the purple circles show its course over the
              past 25 seconds; we can see that it is turning to the right. Finally, the "G" in the middle of the circle
              indicates which controller has owner of the aircraft's track.
            </p>

            <p>A single controller may own an aircraft's track and a single controller may have <i>control</i> of an
              aircraft. The same controller may be responsible for both. A controller must own control of an aircraft in
              order to issue instructions to the pilot. See the discussion of <a href="#stars-track-ownership">Track
                Ownership</a> below for more information about how control and track ownership are transferred between
              controllers.
            </p>

            <!-- track ownership and handoff -->
            <!-- TCPs and sector ids -->

          <section class="docs-section" id="stars-dcb">
            <h2 class="section-heading">The DCB</h2>
            <!-- <p>Display control bar (DCB)</p> -->
          </section>

          <section class="docs-section" id="command-entry">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Entering Commands</h2>
            <p>Some STARS commands are entirely keyboard based: you enter a
              command and hit the "enter" key to issue the command.
              As you type, your input will be shown in the <i>input area</i>,
              which is by default on the left side of the screen.
              Entering a space starts a new line.
              To edit your input, the backspace key can be used.
              Alternatively, hitting the escape key clears the input (and
              any errors that are displayed).
            <p>
            <p>Many STARS commands involve selecting an aircraft that they
              apply to; in
              STARS this is called "slewing" the aircraft. To slew an
              aircraft in <i>vice</i>, click on its radar track with the
              left mouse button. You will often enter a command with the
              keyboard and then slew an aircraft; if the documentation
              below, <code>[SLEW]</code> indicates that an aircraft should
              be slewed to execute the command.
            </p>
            <p>Many STARS keyboard commands take additional parameters such as a number
              or the name of an airport. These will be shown in parenthesis with the number
              and type of character expected. Thus <code>(#)</code>
              indicates that a single digit should be entered, without any parenthesis.
              Similarly, <code>(ABC)</code> indicates that three letters are expected.
            </p>
            <p>Many keyboard commands take an aircraft identifier, which will be denoted <code>(ACID)</code> in the
              following. The aircraft identifier may be given as either the aircraft's complete callsign, e.g.,
              "UAL650", or as just part of the aircraft's callsign, if that is sufficient to unambiguously identify the
              aircraft, e.g., "L65".
            </p>
            <p>The STARS keyboard has a number of custom keys that are not present on standard keyboards.
              <i>vice</i> uses the same mappings to regular keys as <a
                href="https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/stars">CRC STARS</a> does.
              In the following documentation, when one of the STARS keys in square brackets below is shown, the
              corresponding
              regular keyboard key should be entered.

          <section class="docs-section" id="stars-control">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Other Controllers</h2>
            <h3>Specifying Controller ID</h3>
            <p><i>vice</i> emulates correct sector IDs for controllers.</p><br><br>
            <h4>Sector ID Breakdown</h4>
            <p>A full controller has three elements. The facility, the area and the sector. Taking a look at an example
              sector ID <code>N4P</code>. The <code>N</code> stands for the
              N90 (New York) TRACON. The <code>4</code> stands for the fourth area/ the Newark area of the N90 TRACON.
              Finally, the <code>P</code> is the Yardley
              sector of the Newark area.</p>

            <h4>Intra-facility specification</h4>
            <p>Intra-facility TCPs are specified with the area of the TRACON, and the sector. So a handoff from
              <code>4P</code> to
              <code>1V</code> would be <code>1V</code>. If the TCP is in the same area as the initiator, the area can be
              ommited.
            </p>

            <h4>Inter-facility specification</h4>
            <p>Specifying inter-facility positions must be specified first with the delta (∆) symbol, which is mapped to
              the backtick
              key. They also must be specified with the receiver TCP's facilty. For example, a handoff from an N90
              position to a position in the
              ABE TRACON, it would need the facility identifier for ABE. It must also contain the area and sector ID of
              the receiving TCP. The area and
              sector ID can be ommited if there is only one TCP in that facility, or there is an airspace awareness rule
              (specified in the facility
              configuration file). Then, only the delta symbol and facility need to be specified
            </p>

            <h4>Enroute specification</h4>
            <p>Enroute sectors can be specified with their facility identifier and the sector. For the home ARTCC, the
              facility identifier is
              specified with a <code>C</code>. There is an exeption, if a neigboring ARTCCs facility identifier is a C,
              then the facility identifier
              for the home ARTCC would change from a C to the regular facility identifier. So for ZNY, it would turn
              from a C to N. The sector ID can be ommited
              if there is only one ERAM controller signed on, or there is an airspace awareness rule defined in the
              configuration file.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Tracks and Datablocks</h2>

            <h3>Datablock Types</h3>
            <h4>Partial Datablock</h4>
            <p>Partial Datablocks are associated datablocks that are owned by another TCP. They display line 2 of a full
              datablock. With the exception
              of the groundspeed
            </p>
            <h3>Leader Lines</h3>
            <p>Leader line direction can be changed with <code>leader direction (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9), SLEW</code> or
              <code>MULTI FUNC, L, 
              leader direction (1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9), SPACE, acid or bcn code, | ENTER</code>for the local user.
              Leader lines can also be changed globally with
              <code>MULTI FUNC, L, leader direction (11/22/33/44/55/66/77/88/99), SLEW</code> or
              <code>MULTI FUNC, L, leader dir (11/22/33/44/55/66/77/88/99), SPACE, acid or bcn code, ENTER</code>
            </p>
            <h3>PTL Lines</h3>
            <p>PTL Lines (Predicted Track Lines) show the aircrafts predicted track over the course of 0.5 to 3 minutes.
              These lines can be adjusted in the <code>SHIFT</code>
              menu. <code>PTL OWN</code> will turn on PTLs for tracks that are owned by the TCP, and
              <code>PTL ALL</code> will display PTLs for all associated tracks in range of altitude
              filters.</p>
            <h3>Scratchpads</h3>
            <p>In STARS, scratchpads are used to display information to the controllers. For example, the departure exit
              gate, or the assigned approach.
              Scratchpads are three characters, but can be four if specified in the facility configuration file.
              Scratchpads can consist of alphanumeric characters, plus
              signs, delta symbols, forward slash, and an asterisk. The primary scratchpad can be set with
              <code>scratchpad #1, SLEW</code> (Implied command), or
              <code>MULTI FUNC, Y, scratchpad #1, SLEW</code>. The secondary scratchpad also consists of three
              alphanumeric characters (can be four if specified in the facility
              configuration file). The secondary scratchpad can also consist of plus signs, delta symbols, forward
              slash, and an asterisk. Secondary scratchpads can be entered with
              <code>MULTI FUNC, Y, +, scratchpad #2, SLEW</code> or <code>scratchpad #2, SLEW</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Quicklook</h3>
            <p>When quicklooking a TCP, all tracks that are tracked by the TCP will show as an FDB.
              <code>MULTI FUNC, Q, [SECTOR ID] ENTER</code> will
              quicklook the specified TCP. Or using the implied command: <code>[SECTOR ID] ENTER</code> will also
              quicklook the TCP.</p>
            <h3>Force Quicklook</h3>
            <p>Force Quicklook will turn a datablock yellow, for the receiving TCP. A track can be force quicklooked
              with <code>*,*,[ID], SLEW</code>.
              If specified in the facility configuration file, if owned by the TCP, the controller can force quicklook
              to self with <code>*, *, SLEW</code>.
              The TCP can clear a force quicklook with <code>SLEW</code>.
            </p>
            <h3>Handoffs</h3>
            <p>Handoffs in <i>vice</i> emulates STARS functionality.<br><br> <code>[SECTOR ID], SLEW</code> can ne used
              to initiate a handoff of a track to the
              specified TCP. </p>
            <h3>Pointouts</h3>
            <p>A pointout can be initiated with <code>[SECTOR ID], *, SLEW</code> and will flash the target as yellow to
              the specified TCP. If the TCP
              accepts the pointout, <code>PO</code> will flash in the tracks datablock for five seconds. If the TCP
              rejects the pointout, then <code>UN</code>
              will flash in the tracks datablock for five seconds.<br><br><code>SLEW</code> will accept the pointout and
              <code>UN, SLEW</code> will reject it</p>

            <h3>Redirecting Handoffs</h3>
            <p>An incoming handoff can be redirected to another TCP with <code>[SECTOR ID] SLEW</code>. Doing this will
              add <code>RD</code> to the handoff initiators datablock,
              to the redirectors datablock, and to the TCP to where the track was redirected to. It will also turn the
              datablock green for the redirector.</p>

            <h3>Full and Partial Datablocks</h3>

            <p>The FDB is displayed for a track if:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The track is owned by the current controller.</li>
              <li>The track is being handed off from another controller to the current controller.</li>
              <li>The track is a redirected handoff where the current controller has either redirected it or had it
                redirected to them.</li>
              <li>Another controller has pointed out the track to the current controller and the point out hasn't been
                cleared.</li>
              <li>The user has clicked on a track owned by another controller.</li>
              <li>The track is owned by a controller whose sector id the user has quicklooked.</li>
              <li>The track has been force quicklooked to the current controller by another controller.</li>
              <li>"Quick look all" has been enabled by the controller.</li>

            <h3>Collision Alerts</h3>
            <p>If there is a loss of separation between aircraft or if STARS predicts an imminent loss of separation, a
              collision alert will be issued where red text "CA" is shown in the aircraft datablocks and an alert sound
              will be played. The alert sound continues until one of the aircraft is slewed. Here is an example of a
              pair of aircraft with CA alerts:</p>

            <p>If aircraft are beneath the minimum vectoring altitude at their location, a minimum safe altitude warning
              (MSAW) may be issued. Aircraft with MSAWs have "LA" (for "low altitude") displayed in red at the top of
              their datablocks. An alert sound is played when an MSAW is issued; it can be silenced by slewing the
              corresponding aircraft. Here is an example of such an aircraft:</p>

            <h3>Predicted Track Lines</h3>

            <h3>Range Bearing Lines</h3>
            <p>Range bearing lines (RBLs) track the distance and heading between aircraft and/or fixes.
              For example, the image below shows an RBL between two aircraft, indicating that WJA466 is 8.46nm
              miles along a 246 heading for DLH0VZ. (Alternatively, the RBL could have been set up to be
              from WJA466 to DLH0VZ, in which case the distance would be the same but the heading would be 246-180=66.)
              The "-1" at the end indicates that this is RBL number 1. If additional RBLs were created, they would
              be given successive numbers to identify them.

            <p>ATPA automatically generates cones for aircraft in the <i>approach volume</i> for a runway.
              (Approach volumes are generally along the glideslope for a runway.) For example, the image below

              The in-trail distance is shown in WJA466's datablock, and both that distance and the cone are red,
              indicating

            <p>For facility engineers, the ATPA approach volumes are
              listed in the "PROCESSING AREAS" map list, which can be selected
              via "SYS PROC" from the DCB "MAPS" menu. Individual maps can be displayed and then
              hidden by entering <code>[MAPS](###)</code> where ### is the map number associated with the volume.

            <h3>Range Rings</h3>

            <p>Range rings are concentric circles drawn around a selected point with successive steps between
              their radii that are 2, 5, 10, or 20nm. With 5nm steps, the default, here are the 5 and 10nm range rings
              drawn around KEWR:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="rr-example.png" srcset="rr-example-2x.png 2x" width="248" height="245" class="img-fluid"
                alt="Range rings on radar scope">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The brightness of range rings can be controlled with the "RR" spinner in the "BRITE" menu of the main
              DCB.
              If the brightness is set to 0, range rings are not drawn. A few buttons on the main DCB make it possible
              to
              configure range rings. Clicking on "RR" activates a spinner that allows selecting the step between radii.
              If "PLACE RR" is clicked, then the next location clicked on the radar scope will become the range rings'
              center point.
              Finally, clicking "RR CNTR" causes the range rings to be centered on the point at the center of the radar
              scope.

            <p>The radius of the range rings can also be set by entering <code>[RANGE]</code> and then 2, 5, 10, or 20,
              and then pressing enter.

            <h3>Weather</h3>

            <p>The current weather radar can be displayed on the STARS scope. Here is an example South of KSEA.
              The blue-green areas indicate light precipitation, while the mustard-colored area is moderate to heavy
              precipitation.
              Stippling in the radar also indicates the strength, where a denser stipple is heavier precipitation.</p>

            <p>The brightness of the radar on the STARS scope can be controlled using the "WX" spinner in the "BRITE"
              menu of the DCB.
              It is also possible to control which levels of precipitation are shown using the "WX*" buttons in the main
              DCB:

            <br>
            <p>With the selection above, the two lowest levels, WX0 and WX1, are not shown, while all of the higher
              levels
              of precipitation are.</p>

            <h3 id="crda">CRDA</h3>

            <p>The Converging Runways Display Aid (CRDA) helps ensure separation between aircraft approaching
              intersecting runways, on parallel approaches, and in related situations. It does so by drawing
              "ghost" aircraft on one course that correspond to aircraft on another course. The idea is perhaps
              best understood with an example:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="crda.png" srcset="crda-2x.png 2x" width="406" height="275" class="img-fluid" alt="CRDA example">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Here two aircraft are approaching KPHL, one with PDT4783 landing runway 27R and PDT4517 landing runway
              35.
              With CRDA enabled, a ghost of PDT4783 is drawn on the runway 35 approach course. We can easily see that
              PDT4517
              will reach the threshold of runway 35 well before PDT4783 reaches runway 27R.</p>
            <p>Ghost aircraft may be positioned via either "stagger" or "tie" mode. With stagger mode, the ghosts
              are the same difference from a common point (e.g., the intersection of two runways); the controller's
              goal is then to ensure adequate separation between ghost and actual aircraft radar tracks.
              Alternatively, with tie mode, ghosts are offset so that the controller's goal is to have actual
              aircraft radar tracks coincide with the ghost tracks in order to achieve separation.</p>
            <p>When CRDA is available at an airport, the CRDA status list may be displayed on the STARS scope.
              Entering <code>[MULTIFUNC]TN</code> toggles whether it is shown, and <code>[MULTIFUNC]TN[SLEW]</code>
              repositions it on the screen. In the example below, we can see from the "S" in the line below "CRDA
              STATUS"
              that CRDA is enabled in stagger mode for
              runways 27R/35 at KPHL for the current controller, who has id 6N.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="crda-status.png" srcset="crda-status-2x.png 2x" width="206" height="108" class="img-fluid"

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Ghost radar tracks are normally only generated for aircraft within a pre-defined volume of space around
              an
              approach course and only if their heading is within a specified range of the approach heading.
              However, a number of commands below allow <i>forcing</i> a ghost track even if these criteria
              are not met.</p>
            <p>A variety of commands are available to configure CRDA. Some take an airport's identifier, which
              should be given without the initial "K": i.e., "PHL" for Philadelphia, not "KPHL":</p>

            <h3>System Lists</h3>
            <p>The system lists show various types of useful information in the form of text. Their font size can be
              adjusted using the "LISTS" control in the "CHAR SIZE" DCB menu and their brightness is set with "LST" in
              the "BRITE" DCB menu.

            <p><i>vice</i> currently doesn't support two STARS system
              lists: the VFR List and the Coast/Suspend List; both will be added in the
              future when the aircraft simulation supports VFR and lost radar
              tracks. Otherwise, all of the system lists other than one for CRDA are
              documented in the following; see the <a href="#crda">CRDA documentation

            <h4>System Status Area List</h4>
            <p>The System Status Area (SSA) list displays general information about the configuration of the STARS radar
              scope. Here is an example:</p>

            <br>
            <p>The red triangle indicates that STARS is functioning correctly; in <i>vice</i> it will always be there.
              The first line of text shows the current zulu time 06:12:27 and the altimeter and winds at the primary
              airport, JFK. The following line shows the network status (always "OK/OK/NA" in <i>vice</i>) as well as
              the current radar mode, which may be "FUSED", "MULTI", or "SINGLE". Next is the current range shown from
              the scope's center, 41nm, and the length of predicted track lines (PTLs). Next are the altitude filters,
              first for unassociated tracks and then for associated tracks (both in hundreds of feet.) The next few
              lines show the altimeter and winds at nearby airports.</p>
            <p>A few lines are only shown when corresponding features are enabled. Here, "QL: 4P" indicates that sector
              id 4P has been <a href="#quicklook">quicklooked</a> and "TW OFF: MSAW" indicates that <a
                href="#msaw">MSAW</a> has been disabled system-wide. When <a href="#crda">CRDA</a> is enabled for a

            <p><i>vice</i> supports the following features from STARS that
            are not present in <a href="https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/stars">CRC STARS</a>:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>vice</i> supports the STARS "dwell" mode, which draws
                the datablock and leaderline of track under the mouse more
                brightly when it is enabled. Dwell mode can be configured
                by choosing "SHIFT" from the main DCB menu and then
                selecting the "DWELL" button, or via the following keyboard
                commands:
                <ul>
                  <li><code>[MULTIFUNC] D E</code>: enable dwell mode.</li>
                    <li><code>[MULTIFUNC] D L</code>: lock dwell
                      mode&mdash;the selected aircraft remains highlighted
                      even if it or the mouse cursor moves.</li>
                    <li><code>[MULTIFUNC] D I</code>: inhibit (disable) dwell mode.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><i>vice</i> supports the "plus" specifier for quicklook:
                      if a plus sign is specified after a controller id
                      when enabling quicklook, the datablocks for that controller's tracks will
                      be white, not green. (Similarly, <code>ALL+</code> can be
                      specified to quick look all controllers' traffic in this
                      way.)</li>
                    <li><i>vice</i> supports displaying the current weather radar
                      for the selected location.</li>
                    <li><i>vice</i> issues MSAW alerts for aircraft below the MVA at their present location.</li>

            <section class="docs-intro">
              <p>All of the configuration of <i>vice</i> is via JSON-formatted files.
                Extending <i>vice</i> to include more airports or additional scenarios is a matter
                of generating additional JSON that provides the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p>In the following, the use of terms like "element", "object", "member", "array", etc.,
                correspond to their use in the JSON specification. See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">this
                  page</a> for reference.
              </p>
              <p>See the <a
                  href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/scenarios"><tt>resources/scenarios/</tt>
                  directory</a> in the
                vice source code for the scenarios that are currently available and the
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/videomaps"><tt>resources/videomaps/</tt>
                  directory</a> for
                the video map definitions.
                Files in those directories with names ending with a "zst" suffix have been compressed using <a
                  href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a>;
                in order to examine their contents, you'll want to install zstandard or another decompression program
                that supports that
                format.
              </p>
              <p>When developing scenarios, you might make a copy of an existing scenario's JSON file and modify it in
                order to add more configurations,
                or you or might specify completely new scenario and video map files if you're working on support for a
                new TRACON.
                While you're doing this you can point <i>vice</i> at the
                file you're working on using the command-line: if you open a command prompt and run <i>vice</i> from the
                command line,
                there are two options make it possible to specify
                additional files for testing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <tt>-scenario</tt> command line option takes a single filename.
                  The scenario specified file is loaded at startup time; if it has the same name as an existing
                  scenario, it replaces
                  that scenario's definition.
                </li>
                <li>In a similar manner, the <tt>-videomap</tt> command line option also takes a single filename that
                  specifies a file
                  with video map definitions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you're working on a new scenario, you may omit the "video_map_file" specifier in its JSON file.
                In this case, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the video map file you specified via <tt>-videomap</tt>
                or via the UI.
              </p>
              <p>If you're working on multi-controller support for a
                scenario, you may want to run a <i>vice</i> server locally to
                debug it. A few command-line options are useful:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><tt>-runserver</tt> launches a <i>vice</i> server on
                  your local system</li>
                <li><tt>-server</tt> specifies the IP address and port of a <i>vice</i>
                  server to connect to. Specifying <tt>localhost:8000</tt>
                  will connect to a local server launched via <tt>-runserver</tt>.</li>
                <li><tt>-port</tt> allows specifying a custom port number
                  for the server to listen to.</li>
              </ul>

              <i>vice</i> has a built-in database of all of the airports, VORs, NDBs, and fixes in the United States
              (courtesy of the FAA),
              which allows using these directly for specifying locations. The locations of runway thresholds are
              available via the syntax
              <code>KJFK-22L</code> where the airport name and runway specifier are separated by a hyphen.
            </p>

            <p>Locations can also be specified via
              latitude-longitude positions, given as strings. For convenience, multiple latitude-longitude formats are
              supported.

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-routes">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Routes</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> uses a custom syntax for specifying the routes of aircraft, both for arrivals and departures.
              In addition to the lateral positions along the route, it is possibly to specify speed and altitude
              restrictions, handoff points,
              and headings to fly.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example route from a JFK departure. The first two waypoints along the departure runway are
              automatically
              provided by <i>vice</i> so the route starts with the specified fixes in the departure procedure.
              The "/h223" after "RNGRR" specifies that the aircraft should fly a 223 heading as departing RNGRR.
              It will maintain that heading until it
              is further vectored by the controller. If there are further fixes after such a heading, the aircraft may
              be sent direct to one of
              those fixes by the controller.</p>
            <pre>
  "SKORR METSS RNGRR/h223"
            </pre>
            <p>A number of items like headings can be specified with a fix:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>/a</code><i>restriction</i>: cross the fix with the specified altitude restriction (with
                altitudes specified in 100s of feet).
                The following options are available for specifying altitude restrictions:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>low</i><code>-</code><i>high</i>: cross at an altitude between <i>low</i> and <i>high</i>.</li>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>-</code>: cross at or below <i>alt</i>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>+</code>: cross at or above <i>alt</i>
                  <li><i>alt</i>: cross at <i>alt</i>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <code>/delete</code><i>heading</i>: the aircraft will be deleted when it reaches the fix</li>
              <li> <code>/h</code><i>heading</i>: depart the fix at specified heading</li>
              <li> <code>/s</code><i>speed</i>: cross the fix at the given speed</li>
              <li> <code>/ho</code>: the aircraft should be handed off from the virtual controller to the user when it
                departs the fix</li>
              <li> <code>/iaf</code>: indicates that the fix is an IAF (initial approach fix)</li>
              <li> <code>/if</code>: indicates that the fix is the IF (intermediate fix)</li>
              <li> <code>/faf</code>: indicates that the fix is the FAF (final approach fix)</li>
              <li> <code>/flyover</code>: indicates that the fix is
                a <i>flyover</i> fix (as opposed to the
                default, <i>fly-by</i>). Aircraft must pass directly over flyover
                fixes before turning to the next fix, while they may turn
                early with fly-by fixes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the aircraft should follow an arc leaving a
              fix, <code>/arc</code> can be given after the fix.
              It can be used in two ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both a radius in nautical miles as well as the fix at the
                center of the arc's circle can be specified. For
                example, <code>HANAV/arc16OMN</code> specifies a 16nm radius
                arc centered at <code>OMN</code>.</li>
              <li>Alternatively, just the length of the arc may be given.
                For example, <code>WUPMA/arc7.5 ALABE</code> has aircraft fly along the 7.5nm long arc between WUPMA and
                ALABE.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For both uses, the direction of the arc is
              automatically determined based on the position of the following fix.
            </p>
            <p>For approach fixes that have procedure turns, a number of additional items can be specified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>/hilpt</code>: there is a hold in lieu of procedure turn (i.e., a racetrack procedure turn)
                associated with the fix.
                The default is right turns and a 1 minute limit for ILS approaches and a 4 nm limit for RNAV approaches.
                Different limits can be specified directly; for example <code>/hilpt6nm</code> gives a procedure turn
                with a 6 nm limit and
                <code>/hilpt2min</code> specifies a 2 minute limit. For left turns, add a <code>l</code> after the
                slash, like
                <code>/lhilpt</code>.
              </li>
              <li><code>/pt45</code>: specifies that there is a standard 45 degree procedure turn at the fix. (This has
                the same defaults&mdash;
                right turns, 1 minute (ILS) / 4 nm (RNAV)&mdash;as HILPTs. Alternative values are specified the same
                way.)</li>
              <li><code>/pta</code><i>altitude</i>: if the aircraft should descend during the procedure turn, this can
                be used to specify
                the final altitude it should have at the end of the turn. (The altitude should be given in 100s of
                feet.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt180</code>: specifies that aircraft approaching the fix in the 180 degree semicircle of
                directions aligned
                with the final approach course should not perform the procedure turn. (As an example, see the <a
                  href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2305/05570RZ8.PDF">KJAX RNAV Z 8</a> approach; this applies for
                aircraft between heading 346 and 166
                arriving at UDAQI.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt</code>: when specified at a fix prior to one with a procedure turn, indicates that
                aircraft that
                pass that fix should not fly the procedure turn.</li>

            <p>Both departures and arrivals need to know about which airlines fly their routes and which aircraft they
              use for them.
              Airlines are specified via their ICAO strings (e.g., AAL for American Airlines). See the file
              <a
                href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/blob/master/resources/openscope-airlines.json">openscope-airlines.json</a>
              for the database of possible airlines.
              In that file, each airline may have one or more aircraft fleets specified, in its "fleets" member.
              If no fleet is specified, <i>vice</i> randomly chooses an aircraft type from the "default" fleet, but if
              a particular fleet's aircraft is a better match to a route, you may want to use it.
              For example, AAL's "long" fleet would be a good choice for trans-Atlantic flights.
            </p>
            <p>For reference, the available types of aircraft and their performance characteristics are available in the

            <p>The member names in the airport "approaches" object give the abbreviated name of each approach,
              as used in <i>vice</i>'s <a href="#commands">ATC commands</a>.</p>

            <p>Approaches may be specified using data automatically loaded from the
              <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/">FAA CIFP</a> or
              manually.
              To use CIFP data, run <i>vice</i> from the command-line and give it the argument <code>-route KXYZ</code>,
              where
              <code>KXYZ</code> is the ICAO code for the airport. <i>vice</i> will print identifiers for the available
              approaches
              and their associated waypoints. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
  > ...\vice.exe -routes KMIA
  [...]  
  Approaches:
  I12  : DHP GLRIA/a3000+/lhilpt1.0min/pta3000/iaf PIANA/a3000+ VEPCO/a2000+

  [...]
</pre>
            <p>Approach ids encode the type of approach&mdash;for example, <code>I12</code> is an
              ILS approach to runway 27 and <code>RY12</code> is an RNAV Y runway 12 approach.
              Given the id, the approach can be specified with:</p>

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-departures">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Departures</h2>

            <p>There are two pieces for specifying departures: their initial route leaving the airport, which depends on
              the active departure runway,
              and their subsequent route out of the TRACON, which does not. These two parts are specified separately.
            </p>
            <p>The "departure_routes" object in the airport definition gives the initial routing for departures,
              based both on the runway they are departing as well
              as their exit fix. Here is an excerpt from the KJFK departure routes:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "departure_routes": {
    "13R": {
      "ARD,DIXIE,RBV,WHITE": {
        "cleared_altitude": 5000,
        "sid": "JFK5",
        "waypoints": "KJFK-31L/h185"
      },
      ...
            </pre>
            <p>The members of "departure_routes" are strings identifying the departure runway; each departure runway's
              routes
              are then represented by an object with one or more members that specify comma-separated lists of exit
              fixes.
              (Thus, the specification above applies to departures with
              exit ARD, DIXIE, RBV, or WHITE, departing runway 13R.)</p>
            <p>
              The exit fix specifiers may include additional text after a
              period to allow specifying situation-dependent exits.
              For example, we might specify one route
              for "RBV.PISTONS", another for "RBV.TURBOPROPS", and a third
              for "RBV.JETS". <i>vice</i> treats all of these as going to
              the "RBV" exit. When departures are defined in
              "departures", they can then refer to the appropriate exit in
              their "exit" specifier.
            </p>
            <p>
              The departure route specification includes the following members:

            <h2 class="section-heading">Arrivals</h2>

            <p>Arrivals are specified via the "arrival_groups" variable, which allows specifying one or more STARs that
              bring aircraft to the TRACON. Members of "arrival_groups" give the names of arrival groups; each one
              stores
              an array of one or more arrival objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because arrival rates are specified per-arrival group rather than per-STAR,
              <i>vice</i> can simulate center controllers sequencing multiple STARs into a single arrival flow rather
              than
              spawning arrivals on two STARs that follow nearby routes and thus should be sequences.
            </p>
            <p>Each object stored in an "arrival_groups" array corresponds to a STAR.
              These objects have the following members:

            <p>STARs are sometimes able to deliver aircraft to multiple airports. Therefore, the "airlines" member
              is an object with airport names as members. Each of the airports is associated with an array of objects
              that specify departure airports, airlines, and (optionally) airline fleets. Here is an excerpt from the
              CAMRN4 arrival group at KJFK:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "airlines": {
    "KFRG": [
      {
        "airport": "KDCA",
        "icao": "EJA"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "KJFK": [
      {
        "airport": "MMMY",
        "fleet": "long",
        "icao": "AMX"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
            </pre>
            <p>We can see that CAMRN4 applies to both the KFRG and KJFK airports, though with different airlines
              and different departure airports for the arrivals. The specified departure airports (here, KDCA and MMMY)
              are only used so that flight strips and data blocks on the scope are realistic, but the specified airlines
              are used to select the type of aircraft from their fleets. As elsewhere, a value for "fleet" may be
              specified
              to limit which types of aircraft may be chosen.
            </p>

            <p>There are two ways to specify a STAR's waypoints: automatically using data loaded from the
              <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/">FAA CIFP</a> or
              manually. To use CIFP data, ensure that the STAR is available by running vice from the command-line
              and providing the <code>-routes KXYZ</code> argument, where <code>KXYZ</code> is the name of the
              airport. <i>vice</i> will print the available STARS with their transitions. For example,
            </p>
            <pre>
> ...\vice -routes KLGA
STARs:
APPLE3.SHLBK: SHLBK LOUIE/a13000 BACKY ODESA DQO RUUTH WNDYL BRAND/a8000 KORRY DEPDY TYKES MINKS JERZY RENUE APPLE PROUD/flyover/h45

APPLE3.ALL  : RUUTH WNDYL BRAND/a8000 KORRY DEPDY TYKES MINKS JERZY RENUE APPLE PROUD/flyover/h45
[...]
</pre>
            <p>If the STAR specified
              in the "star" parameter is present, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the available routes to define the
              STAR's
              transitions and runway-specific waypoints. In that case, one additional parameter must be specified:</p>
            <table class="table">

                <tr>

                  <td>String</td>
                  <td>The name of the waypoint in the STAR at which new arrivals should start.
                    A point between two waypoints in the STAR can be specified using an "@" symbol
                    and a number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of distance between
                    the waypoint and the next. For example, "STW@0.6" specifies that aircraft should
                    spawn 0.6 of the way between STW and the following waypoint.
                    Aircraft will then be handed off from the center controller halfway between the
                    first two waypoints of the route.

                    "runway_waypoints"
                    must match the last waypoint in "waypoints". (See the example below.)</td>

            <p>The "runway_waypoints" member can be used for STARs that have different routes depending on the arrival
              airport and runway.
              When the user instructs the aircraft to expect a particular approach then the corresponding waypoints are
              added to its route. As an example, the specification of the KPHL <a
                href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2305/00320JIIMS.PDF">JIIMS4 arrival</a>

              (The second point is used to set the handoff point to be between HEKMN and JIIMS.)
              It then has the following "runway_waypoints", corresponding to the runway-specific routes into KPHL, the
              only active airport in the scenario.
              Note that all start with JIIMS, the same fix at the end of "waypoints".

            <p>Airspace volumes may optionally be specified using the "airspace" object in the scenario group.
              These volumes may be assigned to controllers in scenarios, in which case <i>vice</i> will show an

            <p>Each member in "boundaries" names a polyline of one or more line segments. Polylines are specified by
              arrays of locations.
              The first and second points specify the first line, the second and third points specify the second line,
              and so forth.
              Here is an example from the KPHL airspace:

  "PHL_DQO27_33": [

    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977"
  ]
</pre>
            <p>Note that the first point and the last point are at the same location and thus, "PHL_DQO27_33" is a
              closed polygon.
              Airspace boundaries do not have to be polygons like this; because boundaries are generally shared between
              different
              volumes of airspace, it's often useful to define boundaries just as polylines and to assemble multiple
              boundaries
              to define the lateral extent of a volume of airspace.
            </p>
            <p>Given the boundaries, "volumes" specifies full 3D volumes of airspace. Airspace volumes have three
              members; "boundaries"
              is an array of strings that names the boundaries that give the airspace's lateral extent, and "lower" and
              "upper" specify the
              altitude range of the airspace. Here is an example from KPHL that uses the boundary defined above:

            <h3>Video Maps</h3>
            <p>Video maps are specified separately from the rest of the configuration since they require fairly large
              files and are not normally edited by hand.
              Video map files are simply JSON files with a series of members, each one of which stores an array of
              strings giving latitude-longitude positions.
              Each successive pair of positions specifies a line to be draw when rendering the video map.
              The following shows an excerpt from the ZNY video maps file that gives a sense of the format.

              There are utility programs available for extracting video maps from
              both vSTARS configuration files and from installed CRC
              ARTCCs.

                  releases</a> page.
                It is a command-line program: the first argument should be
                the path to a VSTARS configuration file and the second a path
                to an output file.
