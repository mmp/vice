	    <h1 class="docs-heading">About Vice</h1>

	    <section class="docs-intro">
	      <p><i>vice</i> is an air traffic control simulator, focused on TRACON.
                It presents a STARS-like interface, but with simulated traffic and other controllers.
                It also supports multiple users, where each person controls a different position at a facility.
              </p>
              <p><i>vice</i> supports departure and arrival control
                scenarios in numerous TRACONs and ATCT/TRACONs, currently:

                New scenarios are regularly added.
                Adding scenarios at additional airports is a matter of writing JSON configuration files that describe them;
                see <a href="#section-facility-engineering">below</a> for
                documentation about how scenarios are defined.</p>
              <p>There is a <i>discord</i> server for <i>vice</i>: the <a href="https://discord.gg/y993vgQxhY">Vice ATC Simulator</a> server,
                for general discussion, bug reports and feature requests, and for discussing facility engineering.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The radar client interface that <i>vice</i> provides is based on STARS.
              For familiarity to VATSIM controllers, <i>vice</i> generally follows the keyboard command scheme implemented
              in <a href="https://crc.virtualnas.net/docs/#/">CRC's STARS implementation</a>; see
              the discussion of <a href="#section-stars"><i>vice</i>'s STARS
              emulation</a> below for more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first time you launch <i>vice</i>, a window is shown for configuring the simulation.
              (After the first time, the window can be brought up by clicking the "replay" button in the menubar: <i class="fas fa-redo"></i>.)
              A number of scenarios are available, some departure-only and
              some including both departures and arrivals.
              Here is an example:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config.png" srcset="config-2x.png 2x" width="619" height="668" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After selecting an ARTCC, the available TRACONs and ATCT/TRACONs in that ARTCC are shown.
              Selecting one of those gives a number of scenarios to choose from. Here the ZNY ARTCC has
              been selected and then the PHL ATCT/TRACON. After choosing a scenario and clicking the "Next"
              button, a window with further settings is shown:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="config-rates.png" srcset="config-rates-2x.png 2x" width="518" height="485" class="img-fluid" alt="configuration rates dialog box">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              In the second configuration window, you can set the airport departure rate (ADR)
              for all of the airports that may have departures in the scenario as well as the airport arrival rate (AAR) for all of the
              arrival airports.
              (The PHL scenario only includes the Philadelphia Airport, though many other scenarios include multiple airports.)
              Both of these rates are specified in terms of aircraft per hour, so an ADR of 30 corresponds to one aircraft departing
              every two minutes (on average).
              If you'd like an arrival-only scenario, for example, just set all of the departure rates to zero.
            </p>
            <p>
              For arrivals, the "Go around probability" slider allows setting the probability that each arrival goes around.
              You may also select "Include random arrival pushes", which will periodically bump up the rate of
              arrivals to increase the challenge of vectoring aircraft.
              "Push frequency" sets how often arrival pushes happen and "Length of push" sets how long they last
              before traffic returns to regular levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you have configured the simulation, click "Ok" and you will have a STARS scope and flight strip window to work with.
              Use the usual STARS commands as appropriate (to initiate track, accept handoffs, handoff to other controllers, etc.),
              and the additional <a href="#atc-commands">ATC commands below</a> to issue control commands to aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the simulation starts, you may click on the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button in the menubar to show
              a window with information about the scenario, including the active controllers, the departures, arrivals, approaches and
              overflight routes, and airspace awareness rules.
              For this PHL scenario, four arrivals, two approaches, and three departures are active.
              Other scenarios may be more complex.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="approaches.png" srcset="approaches-2x.png 2x" width="439" height="435" class="img-fluid" alt="approach list">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
              The approach codes&mdash;here, "27R" and "35"&mdash; are used in <i>vice</i>'s aircraft control commands like "expect approach"
              and "cleared approach".
            </p>
            <p>To adjust the amount of space used for flight strips, right click the line separating the flight strips from the
              radar window and drag left or right with your mouse.
              You can also remove flight strips entirely by opening the settings window, <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> in the menubar, and disabling "Show flight strips" under the "Flight strips" header.
            </p>
            <p>
              A number of buttons are available in the menu bar at the top of the window:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-pause-circle"></i> / <i class="fas fa-play-circle"></i>: pause or resume the simulation.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-redo"></i>: opens the window to select a new scenario and set its parameters.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>: open a window that allows changing various settings. The most useful one is the simulation rate: you can speed up time during slow times or to increase the challenge.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i>: show the
                window that lists the currently active departures,
                  arrivals, and approaches.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i>: opens a window that
                shows a summary
                of <i>vice</i>'s <a href="#atc-commands">ATC commands</a>
                and frequently-used STARS commands.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>: open a window with controls for launching aircraft, either automatically or manually.</li>
                <li> <i class="fas fa-book"></i>: open this webpage to review <i>vice</i>'s documentation.</li>

              </ul>
            <p>
              When you exit <i>vice</i>, it remembers everything going on&mdash;all of the aircraft in flight, the instructions they have been given, etc.
              The next time you launch <i>vice</i>, it loads all of that back in and you can continue where you left off.
              If you'd like to start something new, just click <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> and configure a new simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <i>vice</i> is paused, you can hover the mouse above a radar track to see information about the instructions the aircraft has been given so far&mdash;for example, altitude and speed assignments, whether it has been sent direct to a fix, the approach it has been assigned, etc.  An example is shown below.  This information is especially useful when resuming a <i>vice</i> session after you have been away from it for a while.
              </p>

            <br>
            <p>If you are signed in to Discord, <i>vice</i> can
            automatically update your activity status there with
            information about your current <i>vice</i> session (the number
            of arrivals and departures, the position you're controlling,
            etc.) When you first launch <i>vice</i> you are given the
              option to disable this feature if you would like.  The
              settings window, available by clicking <i class="fas
            fa-cog"></i> in the menubar, can also be used to enable or
            disable this feature.

	  <section class="docs-section" id="draw-routes">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Drawing Routes</h2>
            <p><i>vice</i> can draw the active departures, approaches, and
            arrivals for the current simulation. This can be helpful when
            studying those for an airport, since they are drawn directly on
            the radar scope with annotations that give the fixes, any
              altitude or speed restrictions, and procedure turns.
            </p>
            <p>To toggle whether a route is drawn on the scope, click the checkbox on the left 
              next to it in the information window that is shown at
              the start or after clicking on the
              <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button in the menubar.
              For example, here is how the <a href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2409/00671R2.PDF">HVN RNAV Runway 2 approach</a> is rendered:

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>We can see the procedure turn at PEPER and that it is both
            the IAF and the IF; altitude restrictions at both SALLT and
            PEPER, that SALLT is the FAF, and that arrivals from KEYED will not fly the procedure
              turn.</p>

	  <section class="docs-section" id="launches">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Launching Aircraft</h2>
            <p>When a new simulation starts, <i>vice</i> automatically launches new departures and arrivals based on the
              departure and arrival rates set in the "New Simulation" window.
              During a simulation, clicking on the departing plane icon in the menubar <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i>
              opens a window that allows more control over aircraft launches and also for issuing releases for airports
              where "hold for release" is in effect.
            </p>
            <p>The rates for automatic launches can be adjusted in this window. Alternatively, aircraft can be launched manually.  If manual launches are selected,
              the window shows all of the available departure runways and exits as
              well as all of the arrivals, as shown below. Clicking the aircraft icon for a departure or arrival
              causes the aircraft shown to be launched.  If you'd like a different aircraft for the
              next launch (for example, to have a heavy aircraft), click the redo icon <i class="fas fa-redo"></i> until you're happy with the selection.
              The window also shows the elapsed time since the launch of each type as well as how many
              miles in trail (MIT) there would be if the next aircraft was launched.
              To delete all of the aircraft from the simulation and restart, click the trash icon:

            <h2 class="section-heading">Multiple Controllers</h2>

            <p>With <i>vice</i> you can also have multiple controllers working aircraft together.
              Select "Create multi-controller" in the "New Simulation" window and
              you can select an ARTCC, ATCT/TRACON, and scenario in the same way
              that you do with a single controller.
              For multi-controller scenarios, there are some additional settings, shown beneath
              the list of scenarios:

            <br>
            <p>
              Each multi-controller simulation has a name associated with it;
              <i>vice</i> chooses a random one by default (above, it's "choice-length").
              You're welcome to choose a different name if you prefer.
              These names can be used so that you can tell other people which
              simulation to choose in order to join you.
              You may also enable "Require password" and enter a password for the
              simulation so that only people you allow can join it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Selecting "Join multi-controller" shows a list of the simulations
              that are currently available, including how many controllers
              are signed into each one.
              Note that the simulation names are shown in the first column.
              After selecting one, you can choose one of the available control
              positions and join.
              <i>vice</i> also allows you to join a simulation as an observer,
              in which case you have no control capabilities.

	  <section class="docs-section" id="atc-commands">
            <h2 class="section-heading">ATC Instructions</h2>

            <p>A variety of instructions can be issued to aircraft by an aircraft controller.
              To issue an instruction, first press the <code>[TAB]</code> key.
              This will place the STARS radar into "target generation" mode and the characters "TG"
              will appear above the text input area (which is by default on the left side of the STARS
              window, towards the top.  STARS reverts to normal command entry mode after a valid ATC
              instruction is entered, though target generation can be locked by pressing <code>[SHIFT][TAB]</code>.
            </p>
            <p>The commands below can then be entered to issue control commands to aircraft.
              As you enter commands, they will be shown in the STARS input area.
              You can correct errors with the backspace key or press the <code>[ESCAPE]</code> key
              to exit target generation mode.</p>
            <p>To indicate which aircraft should be given a command, you
              can either enter a command and click on an aircraft's radar
              track in the STARS window or you can enter the aircraft's callsign followed by a space
              before the command, and then press the "enter" key. You can also give just the callsign suffix,
              if that is enough to unambiguously identify a single aircraft.
              The callsign of the last aircraft you issued to a command to is shown after "TG" when
              target generation mode is activated.
              If you'd like to give another instruction to that aircraft, you can skip entering its callsign.
              Entering another aircraft's callsign causes the command to be issued to that aircraft instead.</p>
            <p>After you issue a command, the virtual pilot's readback is
              shown in the readback window below the STARS window.
              After receiving an instruction, the aircraft will start
              following that instruction, to the best of its abilities.
              Unlike VATSIM, the pilots will always do exactly what you
              tell them to.
            </p>
            <p>If you'd like to issue multiple commands to an aircraft at once,
              enter the commands one after another with a space between them.
              To open a window that shows the available ATC commands when using <i>vice</i>,
              click the <i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> button in the top menubar.
            </p>

                    handed off at the fix; this is useful for aircraft where control has been flashed from a virtual
                    controller to a human controller earlier but where the virtual controller will continue to
                    control the aircraft for a while before having them contact the human.</li>

              <li>Facility engineering:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added "custom_spcs" in "stars_config" to allow specifying facility-specific special purpose codes that

                  <li><b>Aircraft control commands (like "C80" for "climb
                  and maintain 8,000") are now entered in the radio comms window at the bottom.</b></li>
                  <li>Significantly improved handoffs: multiple redirected handoffs are now supported, inter- and intra-facility handoffs are now handled more accurately.</li>
                  <li>Added support for "force quicklook" to push a quicklook to another controller.</li>
                  <li>Added support for minimum safe altitude warnings (MSAW) for aircraft that are below the MVA.</li>
                  <li>CWT category updates and bugfixes.</li>
                  <li>Added support for global leader lines.</li>
                  <li>Limited datablocks are now supported (and used when appropriate).</li>
                  <li>Added point out history command.</li>
                  <li>Fixed various bugs in DCB spinners (brightness now goes in steps of 5, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where leader lines would be drawn over track symbols.</li>
                  <li>Handle various cases where the FDB should be displayed by default.</li>
                  <li>The scratchpad can now be set by entering text and slewing an aircraft.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>A number of other bug fixes, including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where go-arounds would sometimes not contact departure.</li>
                  <li>Fixed bugs in the winds display in the "new sim" user interface.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where departures handed off to virtual
                    controllers wouldn't climb to their final altitude.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where live weather would occasionally
                    cause vice to crash.</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug where aircraft TAS would be too high at high altitudes.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>In scenario groups, "tracon" must be a valid 3-letter id from the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/air_traffic_services/tracon">FAA list of TRACONs</a>. (This allows <i>vice</i> to present scenarios grouped by ARTCC and then TRACON.)</li>
                  <li>In the <a href="#fe-scenario-groups">specification of controllers in "control_positions"</a>, "eram_facility" and "facility_id" may now be specified.</li>
                  <li><i>vice</i> now has a built-in model of magnetic declination. Therefore, the "magnetic_variation" setting is no longer used. If small adjustments are needed (e.g. due to video maps assuming a different magnetic adjustment, "magnetic_correction" can be used to add a small offset to the automatically-determined value.</li>
                  <li>There is a new "stars_config" field in scenario definitions with a number of new fields to define per-facility STARS behavior. (See the <a href="#fe-stars-videomaps">STARS and Video Maps</a> section for details.) The entries "center", "inhibit_ca_volumes", "radar_sites", "range", "scratchpads", "stars_maps", and "video_map_file" have moved from the scenario to be inside "stars_config".</li>
                  <li>In <a href="#fe-airports">airport specifications</a>, the Boolean value "omit_arrival_scratchpad" may be set to indicate that the arrival airport should not be shown in place of an empty scratchpad in datablocks.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.20 (28 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>Added new scenarios: SCT LAX (Jud Lopez), IND (Samuel Valencia), MKE (Yahya Nazimuddin), MIA (Mike K).</li>
	      <li>Scenario updates/bugfixes: TPA (Connor Allen), SCT ONT/SNA (Eli Thompson), A80, L30 (Michael Trokel).</li>
              <li>STARS: added automated terminal proximity alert (ATPA) support.</li>
	      <li>STARS: consolidated wake turbulence (CWT) categories are now shown in datablocks and used for ATPA in-trail requirements.</li>
	      <li>Live weather can now be used in sims.</li>
	      <li>STARS: fixed various small bugs related to when the FDB should be displayed.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
	          <li>For arrivals, the runway endpoint no longer needs to be included in the route.</li>
	          <li>For departures, the runway start and endpoints no longer need to be included in the route.</li>
                  <li>In STARs, "runway_waypoints" are now specified separately per-airport.</li>
	          <li>Improved support for multi-runway departure scenarios: it is no longer required that each runway have a route for each exit;
                  now it is just required that between all of the active runways at an airport, one of them must have a route for each exit.</li>
	          <li><i>vice</i> is now able to extract STARs and arrival routes from the FAA
                    <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/">Coded Instrument Flight Procedures (CIFP)</a>.
                    These can be incorporated in scenario definitions, simplifying the development of new scenarios.</li>
                  <li>"location" no longer needs to be specified for airports.</li>
                  <li>Waypoints at the thresholds of all runways are now built-in: for example, <code>KJFK-4L</code> gives the threshold
                  of runway 4L at JFK.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.19 (13 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>STARS: fixed bug with flickering airport weather list.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.18 (12 February 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>Added new scenarios: SCT (Justin Nguyen and Eli Thompson), NCT and D01/GJT (Jud Lopez), and TPA (Connor Allen).</li>
	      <li>Smaller scenario updates: D10 and JAX (Mike K), AUS (Jace Martin), LGA, JFK, COS, CLE, ASE, DCA, F11.</li>
	      <li>STARS: more accurate simulation of the STARS weather radar display.</li>
	      <li>Added new syntax for issuing left/right turn in degrees: <code>T10L</code>, <code>T20R</code>, etc.</li>
	      <li>STARS: allow middle-click highlight of aircraft regardless of having their track.</li>
              <li>STARS: fix LDB/FRB/PRI/POS brightness usage when drawing things (hopefully).</li>
              <li>STARS: fixed bug where observers were unable to quicklook other positions.</li>
              <li>Fixed a few cases where <i>vice</i> would crash when given an invalid scenario.</li>
              <li>Improved calculation of the final approach course line, which fixed some bugs with bad approach intercepts.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
	          <li>Arc routes between fixes can now be specified without specifying a center point for the arc's circle:
                    for example, <code>WUPMA/arc7.5 ALABE</code> has aircraft fly along the 7.5nm long arc between WUPMA and ALABE.</li>
                  <li>The "tower_list" property of airports is now used to prioritize tower list assignment rather than used directly.
                    (Thus, if multiple airports have the same "tower_list" value, they no longer try to share the same tower list.)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.17 (15 January 2024)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>Added multiple new scenarios: D10 (Mike K), CYS, ASE, COS (Jud Lopez).</li>
              <li>Fixed multiple bugs with handling of altitude and speed restrictions in departure routes.</li>
              <li>Many small fixes to scenario routes and altitude/speed restrictions.</li>
              <li>Increased acceleration and climb rate of departures to be more realistic.</li>
              <li>Fixed bugs with point outs (couldn't be cleared, incorrect rendering in STARS).</li>
              <li>Fixed bug in the STARS scope that required secondary scratchpads to be three characters.</li>
              <li>When departures are handed off to center, they are only given direct to the exit fix if
                they are on a heading; otherwise they continue flying their route.</li>
              <li>(Re-)added optional sound effect for accepted handoffs.</li>
              <li>Airspace warnings are inhibited for aircraft flying approaches.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where wind would affect aircraft on the ground and blow them off course.</li>
              <li>STARS: allow control-left-click in place of the third mouse button to highlight aircraft.</li>
              <li>STARS: don't allow scratchpads of arbitrary length.</li>
              <li>STARS: actually use the LDB brightness setting for limited/partial datablocks.</li>
              <li>STARS: fix incorrect error message after issuing "at fix, cleared approach".</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixes in routes may have <code>/flyover</code> after
                  them to indicate that aircraft must fly directly over the
                    fix before starting their next turn.</li>
                  <li>It is no longer required to specify radar sites in scenarios; if no sites are given,
                    then STARS Fused mode is always enabled.</li>
                  <li>Departure routes may be given with either "assigned_altitude" or "cleared_altitude".
                    "cleared_altitude" implies "climb via SID": aircraft obey altitude restrictions and
                    climb no higher than the given altitude, while "assigned_altitude" has them climb without
                    restriction to that altitude.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.16 (22 December 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>Added multiple new scenarios: S46, BHM, GSP (Aaron Flett), AUS (Jace Martin), P50 (Mike K)</li>
	      <li>Multi-controller servers can now be password-protected</li>
	      <li>Added "TO" command for "contact tower"</li>
	      <li>Various bugfixes with handoffs and approach navigation</li>
	      <li>Match real-world STARS alert sounds</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes/improvements:
              <ul>
                <li>The scenario group "nm_per_*" settings have been removed and no longer need to be specified.</li>
                <li>Fixed crashes with the <code>-scenario</code>
                  and <code>-videomap</code> command-line options</li>
                <li>It is no longer required to specify "full_name" for
                  approaches; a default name will be assigned using the
                  specified approach type and runway if "full_name" is not
                  given.</li>
                <li>In "departure_routes", the "route" field has been
                renamed to "sid". It is optional to specify "sid"; if the
                aircraft isn't on a published departure it should be left blank.</li>
                <li>In "arrivals", the "route" field has been renamed to "star".</li>
                <li>Approaches now have a "tower_controller" field to specify which tower
                  controller arrivals should contact. If an airport has a single controller
                  named "(airport)_TWR", then "tower_controller" doesn't need to be specified.</li>
                <li>Arrivals specified in "arrival_groups" now have an "assigned_altitude" field
                  (and "cleared_altitude" has been removed.)  If "assigned_altitude" is specified,
                  it is treated as an altitude assignment from a previous controller and the
                  aircraft will not descend further. For aircraft on a STAR that have been cleared
                  to descend via the STAR, "assigned_altitude" should not be given.</li>
                <li>For multi-controller scenarios, departure controllers can be specified per-runway
                  (e.g., "KPHX/25R") or per-SID (e.g., "KJFK/SCORR5").
              </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.15 (19 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>STARS: fixed a bug where RBL lines for *T that included aircraft weren't drawn</li>
	      <li>Added an option to hide the flight strips (Settings window, Flight Strips section)</li>
	      <li>Fixed a bug where inbound handoffs wouldn't send a radio contact message</li>
	      <li>Sped up loading of video maps so that vice launches more
	        quickly</li>
              </ul>

            <h3>0.10.14 (18 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>L30 TRACON (Las Vegas) added, thanks to Michael Trokel.</li>
              <li>Added a combined N90 (JFK, LGA, EWR) scenario.</li>
              <li>Important readbacks from pilots (e.g., "unable") are now highlighted in red.</li>
              <li>Improved STARS *T to allow entering fix names and to show ETA.</li>
              <li>Added support for charted visual approaches.</li>
              <li>STARS allows control-shift click to initiate track (CRC style).</li>
              <li>Secondary scratchpads are now supported.</li>
              <li>Fixed bug that would cause arrivals to climb when vectored off of their STAR.</li>
              <li>Fixed other minor navigation bugs.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering:
              <ul>
                <li>Scenarios can now have "center" and "range" specified; they override the scenario group valus, if present.</li>
                <li>"default_map" in scenarios is now "default_maps"; an array of values can be given, allowing multiple maps to be initially shown.</li>
                <li>Departures from different runways at an airport are sequenced better so that CAs on departure are less likely.</li>
                <li>Added "tracon" to the scenario group definition; this is used to gather scenarios for a single TRACON in the UI.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.13 (5 November 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug that caused vice to sometimes crash after aircraft were given approach clearance.</li>
	      <li>Fixed a bug where descending aircraft would stop descending when given approach clearance.</li>
	      <li>Small fixes to the DCA scenario.</li>
	      <li>Polished up handling of early hand-offs of departures in
	        the STARS scope</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.12 (31 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Added a new DCA scenario.</li>
              <li>Aircraft will now ident if given the "ID" command.</li>
              <li>There is now a short delay (3-6 seconds) before aircraft
              start following heading instructions, to better model reality.</li>
              <li>Control commands for aircraft can now be given without
              slewing on the aircraft: enter their callsign, a space, one
              or more commands, and then hit enter.</li>
              <li>Point outs can be rejected by entering "UN" and slewing
              on the radar track of an aircraft being pointed out.</li>
              <li>RNAV approaches can now be intercepted via a heading.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where departures wouldn't follow altitude
              restrictions on SIDs.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where aircraft that went around would
              always continue to do so on subsequent approaches.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering updates:
              <ul>
                <li>The "multi_controllers" field in scenario definitions
                  is now an object where each entry specifies a control
                  position split. If more than one split is specified, then
                  the user will be prompted to pick one of them when
                  launching a scenario.</li>
                <li>Also in "multi_controllers", a single departure
                  controller is no longer specified using the Boolean
                  "departure". Instead, there is a "departures" field that
                  is an array of strings specifying airports and/or runways
                  that a controller is responsible for.</li>
                <li>Airports have an optional "name" field that is used
                  in transmissions from aircraft when referring to the airport.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.11 (10 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
	      <li>Added the D01 (Denver TRACON) scenario to
		single-user <i>vice</i> (it was unintentionally not
		included in the installer).</li>
              <li>Added support for updating your Discord activity based on
                your <i>vice</i> session (thanks to Samuel Valencia!)</li>
              <li>Clicking the <i class="fas fa-keyboard"></i> icon on the
                menubar opens a window that shows a summary
                of <i>vice</i>'s keyboard commands.</li>
              <li>Fixed a bug with aircraft descending too early when flying procedure turns.</li>
	      <li>Fixed a bug where some departures would try to re-fly
                their initial departure route after being handed off to a
                virtual controller.</li>
	      <li>Fixed multiple bugs with the handling of "at or above" altitude constraints.</li>
	      <li>Fixed a bug that left the default DCB brightness set to
	        0.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.10 (1 October 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug in the Windows installer that caused new
                scenarios (AAC, SAV, SDF) to not be installed locally.</li>
              <li>Added the ability to <a href="#draw-routes">draw active departure, arrival, and
              approach routes on</a> the radar scope.
              </li>
              <li>Facility engineering updates related to the above:
              <ul>
                <li>When specifying fixes in approaches, you can
                  add <code>/iaf</code>, <code>/if</code>
                  and/or <code>/faf</code> to specify that a fix is the
                  initial approach fix, initial fix, or final approach
                  fix. This is then drawn on the scope when the approach is
                  shown but isn't used otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>For arrivals under "arrival_groups", there is an
                optional string "description" field that will be shown in
                the UI. Similarly, for departures in "departure_routes",
                you can also give a "description" string.
                </li>
              </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>0.10.9 (28 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Many improvements to the AAC scenario's accuracy:
              <ul>
                <li>Added turboprop and piston departures and arrivals for AAC.</li>
                <li>AAC jet arrivals now come in on the TULSA4; turboprops
                and pistons pass through their approach gate (at lower
                altitudes) and are routed direct TUL.</li>
                <li>AAC departures now follow headings after takeoff
                (props 010 or 190, jets/turboprops 260/310, depending on
                departure gate.)</li>
                <li>Inbound handoffs are now 45 miles out.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals would sometimes climb after
                being cleared for the approach.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering: when exits are specified in
                "departure_routes", additional text can be included after a
                period. This text is ignored when determining which exit an
                aircraft uses.  This can be useful if for example piston
                aircraft and jets have different departure procedures; 
                "COLIN.P" and "COLIN.J" departure routes could be specified
                with the used for piston aircraft and the second used for jets.

            <h3>0.10.8 (26 September 2023)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>When altitude and speed instructions are given, aircraft
                now do both at once.  To give consecutive commands (e.g.,
                "descend and maintain xxx, then reduce speed to yyy"),
                there is now a <code>TS</code> command for "then speed",
                and <code>TA</code> for "then altitude", or <code>TC</code>
                for "then climb", or <code>TD</code> for "then descend".
                (See the <a href="#atc-commands">ATC command reference</a> for
                details.)
              </li>
              <li>Updates to the JAX, C90, and F11 scenarios and a new

                Valencia!)</li>
              <li>Added a new scenario for KAAC/KJKE.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
              <ul>
                <li>DME arcs can now be <a href="#fe-routes">specified with approaches</a>.</li>
                <li>Scratchpads may be <a href="#fe-airports">specified
                    individually with departures</a>.</li>
                <li>Fixes can now be specified with respect to a distance
                  along a radial from another fix.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Various small bugfixes related to aircraft navigation and
                clearing approaches at fixes.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals would disappear in some
                scenarios (KJAX, KDAB, ...)</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>Added support for STARS fused mode (updates every second,
              round markers for radar tracks; choose "FUSED" in the "SITE menu.)</li>
              <li>It is no longer allowed to issue control commands to
              departing aircraft before they have checked in.</li>
              <li>Added multiple new <a href="#atc-commands">ATC commands</a>:
              <ul>
                <li><code>EC</code>/<code>ED</code>: expedite

              <ul>
                <li>Removed the "elevation" field for airports; it is no

                <li>Radars must have an "elevation" value specified, unless
                  their location is given using an ICAO airport code, in
                  which the airport's elevation is used.</li>

              <li>Added support for the STARS Maps system list.</li>
              <li>Facility engineering changes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Added "reporting_points" to scenarios: fixes aircraft may use
                    when reporting their current position.</li>
                  <li>Added support for specifying volumes of space
                    where collision alerts are inhibited.</li>
                  <li>Altitude restrictions at fixes are now more flexible:
                  rather than just "at", they may be "between", "at or
                    above," or "at or below."</li>

            <h3>0.10.2 (28 July 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Added scenarios for the A80 (ATL) and A80 (BOS) TRACONs (thanks Mike K!).</li>
                  <li>Fixed a bug with drawing *J cones in the STARS scope.</li>
                  <li>Many improvements to the STARS DCB, including better
                    rendering of the buttons, more support for configuring
                    font size and brightness, as well as the ability to

                <ul>
                  <li>Vice now supports multiple controllers working in the
                  same simulation. In the "New Simulation" window, choose
                    "Create multi-controller" to create a new simulation or
                    "Join multi-controller" to join an existing one.

                        scenarios to "solo_controller". Scenarios now take an
                        optional "multi_controllers" object to specify a
                        multi-controller scenario. Added "full_name" to

                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Launches of arrivals and departures can be controlled
                  manually; click on the departing aircraft icon <i class="fas fa-plane-departure"></i> in the
                  menu bar to open a window with launch
                  controls. Alternatively, launch rates can be controlled
                  during a session via that same window.</li>
                  <li>Various improvements to the accuracy of the STARS
                    radar scope simulation.</li>
                  <li>Available approaches are now shown by <i>vice</i> at initial
                  connection time and via the <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i> button
                    in the menu bar.</li>

                  <li>New scenarios and improvements:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Added C90, including O'Hare East and West
                        ops, MDW all configs</li>
                      <li>Added CLE TRACON, including final, feeder, and
                        North/South scenarios</li>
                      <li>Added CLT TRACON, North and South configs</li>

            <h3>0.9.2 (3 July 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Fixed the behavior of *T to better match
                    STARS: the line is now drawn to the mouse
                    position after the first point is selected, without
                    waiting for the second point.</li>
                  <li>Added more checks when loading scenario descriptions;
                    in particular, misspellings and unused JSON objects
                    are detected and an error is issued. This led to
                    numerous small fixes in all of the the scenarios.</li>

                  <li>Fixed a bug where arrivals wouldn't obey altitude
                    restrictions in STARs(!).</li>
                  <li>Improved navigation: crossing restrictions beyond any
                    at the immediately upcoming fix are now
                    considered. Aircraft are now much better at starting
                    altitude and speed adjustments in time to meet the
                    crossing restrictions.</li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>0.9.0 (15 June 2023)</h3>
                <ul>
		  <li>All new flight modeling engine supports procedure turns (both racetrack and standard 45/180)
                    and more accurate turns to intercept localizers, etc.  The approaches in the existing scenarios
                    have been updated to include their procedure turns, where appropriate.</li>
                  <li>A number of new <a href="#atc-commands">aircraft control
                      commands</a> have been added:
                    <ul>

                      <li>Fly present heading</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>When a departure is handed off to a virtual controller, the other controller won't
                    climb it further until after it is clicked by the user to acknowledge the handoff.</li>
                  <li>Fixed very small fonts being used on Windows systems with high-DPI displays</li>
                  <li>Numerous other small fixes and improvements, including in the wind modeling and fixing
                    a case where arrivals would fly faster than the aircraft is capable.</li>
                  <li><i>Facility engineering:</i> In addition to new directives to specify procedure turns,
                    there are a number of changes to how <a href="#fe-routes">routes</a> are specified.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Key Concepts</h2>

            <p>STARS uses RADAR to determine the location of objects in the sky; if an aircraft has a functioning transponder,
              it sends the radar additional information including its altitude, a beacon code it is squawking, and the aircraft's
              callsign (assuming an ADS-B transponder.) For many aircraft, the STARS system doesn't know anything more
              about them (e.g., the aircraft type, the planned route, etc.) Such <i>radar tracks</i> are rendered like this:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">

            <p>There is a <i>position symbol</i> (here, an asterisk), and a green <i>leader line</i> connecting the
              position symbol to the <i>datablock</i>, which here just shows the radar track's altitude, in hundreds of feet.
              The purple dots to the left are the <i>history trail</i>, showing the aircraft's position 5, 10, 15, ...
              seconds in the past.</p>
            <p>Some radar tracks have flight plans associated with them; such tracks are called <i>associated tracks</i>
              (and tracks without a flight plan, as the one above, are <i>unassociated</i>.)
              Given a flight plan, STARS is able to provide more useful information in the aircraft's datablock, as shown here:
              </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="example-track.gif" srcset="example-track-2x.gif 2x" width="148" height="77" class="img-fluid" alt="example aircraft track">
            </div>
            <br>

            <p>Here we see the datablock showing the aircraft's callsign, LXJ137, its altitude in hundreds of feet (040)
              multiplexing with its destination airport (CDW), and its groundspeed in tens of knots (28) multiplexing with
              its aircraft type, CL30. The "H" after groundspeed is the aircraft's <a href="#cwt">consolidated wake turbulence (CWT)</a> category&mdash;upper small. (See the section on <a href="#stars-datablock-types">datablocks</a> for extensive documentation of datablocks and the information that they may show.) For this aircraft, the "P" in the middle of the circle (the <i>position symbol</i>) indicates which controller is the owner of the aircraft's track. (In contrast, unassociated tracks cannot be owned by a controller.)</p>

            <p>Most IFR aircraft automatically have flight plans associated with them.
              For VFR aircraft or for VFRs that request pop-up IFR clearance, a variety of commands are available to
              create flight plans and associate them with aircraft; see the section on <a href="#flight-plans">Flight Plans</a> below.</p>

            <p>A single controller may own an aircraft's track and a single controller may own control of an aircraft.  The same controller may own both or two different controllers may the track and control.  A controller must have control of an aircraft in order to issue instructions to the pilot.  See the discussion of <a href="#stars-track-ownership">Track Ownership</a> below for more information about how control and track ownership are transferred between controllers.
            </p>

            <p>Each controller in the terminal environment is responsible for at least one <i>terminal control position</i> (TCP).
              (A single controller may cover multiple positions when multiple positions have been <i>consolidated</i>.)
              Each TCP is identified by three characters:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The first character gives the <i>facility</i>; more or less the TRACON or ATCT/TRACON where the position is located.</li>
                <li>Facilities are split into multiple <i>area</i>s; the second character which area the TCP is in.</li>
                <li>Finally, each area is split into <i>sector</i>s; these are denoted by the third character.</li>
              </ul>
            
            <p>Consider for example the <code>N4P</code> TCP: the <code>N</code> indicates the 
              N90 (New York) TRACON;  the <code>4</code> is for the fourth area (which is the Newark area)
              of N90; finally, the <code>P</code> is the Yardley sector of the Newark area.</p>

            <p>Other controllers, both real and virtual, may be signed in when you're running a <i>vice</i> scenario.
              The list of controllers is available in the "Controllers" drop-down in the scenario information window.
              Among other useful information, it shows the TCP identifier associated with each controller
              and whether the controller is human.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Entering Commands</h2>
            <p>Some STARS commands are entirely keyboard based: you enter a
              command and hit the <code>[ENTER]</code> key to issue the command.
              As you type, your input will be shown in the <i>input area</i>,
              which is by default on the left side of the screen.
              Entering a space starts a new line.
              To edit your input, the backspace key can be used.
              Alternatively, pressing <code>[ESCAPE]</code> clears the input and
              any errors that are displayed.
              <p>
            <p>Many STARS commands involve selecting an aircraft that they
              apply to; in
              STARS this is called "slewing" the aircraft.  To slew an
              aircraft in <i>vice</i>, click on its radar track with the
              left mouse button.  You will often enter a command with the
              keyboard and then slew an aircraft; if the documentation
              below, <code>[SLEW]</code> indicates that an aircraft should
              be slewed to execute the command. In the following, if a listed command
              doesn't end with <code>[SLEW]</code>, then it should be understood
              that <code>[ENTER]</code> must be pressed to execute the command.
            </p>
            <p>Many STARS keyboard commands take additional parameters such as an aircraft
              callsign, a beacon code number, or a controller identifier. The following
              notation is used for these entries in the documentation below:

              <h3 id="stars-specifying-controllers">Specifying Controllers</h3>

            <p>A number of STARS commands take controller IDs to specify other controllers; examples include handoffs and
              point outs. The following rules apply to them:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>For pairs controllers in the same facility, the full TCP may be entered, 
                  or the facility may be omitted and only the area
                  and sector given. Thus, for a handoff from Yardley, <code>N4P</code>, to
                  LaGuardia departure, <code>N1L</code>, the Yardley controller could specify <code>1L</code>
                  for LaGaurdia departure.</li>
                <li>If the other controller is in the same area of the same facility, then only the sector needs to be entered: for example, <code>N4P</code>
                  can hand off to <code>N4A</code>, the Newark North arrival position, just by specifying <code>A</code> for
                  the TCP.</li>
                <li>For TCPs outside of the facility, the delta (∆) symbol must be specified before the TCP; in
                  <i>vice</i> delta is mapped to the backtick key. The full three-letter TCP may be given,
                  though the area and sector may be omitted if the facility only has one TCP.</li>
                <li>To handoff to an enroute controller, the enroute facility identifier and sector must be provided;
                  enroute sectors are identified by two-digit numbers.
                  For the home ARTCC, the facility identifier is generally <code>C</code>,
                  unless a neighboring ARTCC's facility identifier is "C", in which case
                  the facility identifier for the home ARTCC changes from a "C" to the regular facility identifier.
                  Thus, for ZNY, "N" is used rather than "C". The sector  may be omitted
                  if there is only one enroute controller signed on.</li>
                <li>For handoffs, <i>airspace awareness</i> rules may be
                  provided in the scenario definition; these are rules that associate specific controllers with
                  departing aircraft based on their altitude, the fix they are flying to, and possibly their aircraft type.
                  When such a rule applies to an aircraft, a handoff to a corresponding enroute controller can
                  be initiated simply by entering the enroute facility identifier, without the sector.
                  For a handoff to a controller in a neighboring facility where an airspace awareness rule applies,
                  just ∆ and the facility id are sufficient.</li>
              </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The DCB</h2>

            <p>The display control bar (DCB) is a menu that is shown by default at the top of the STARS window.
              Many aspects of STARS's behavior can be configured using the DCB.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-basic.png" srcset="dcb-basic-2x.png 2x" width="1423" height="74"  style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;">
            </div><br>
            <p>There are four types of buttons in the DCB:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Toggle buttons: these enable and disable various features. When enabled, they have a lighter
                  color than usual and appear depressed (like the "OFF CNTR" and "WX 3", "WX 4", and "WX 5" buttons above.) Clicking them
                toggles whether they are enabled.</li>
                <li>Menu buttons: when clicked, they replace the contents of the DCB with those for another
                  DCB menu. For example, clicking "MAPS" from the main DCB brings up a menu for configuring which
                STARS video maps are displayed.</li>
                <li>Spinners: these allow setting various STARS parameters using the mouse wheel. For example, clicking "RANGE" allows setting the radar's range in nautical miles.  Spinners capture the mouse and don't allow the cursor to leave their button until the user either clicks the mouse or presses the <code>[ESCAPE]</code> key. When a spinner is active, it is also possible to enter a new value for it using the keyboard and then pressing <code>[ENTER]</code>.</li>
                <li>Disabled buttons: these are shown in dark grey and represent STARS functionality that is not currently available in <i>vice</i>.</li> 
              </ul>
            <p>DCB submenus generally have buttons that return to the main DCB menu&mdash;look for a button labeled "DONE" or "SHIFT". Alternatively, pressing the <code>[ESCAPE]</code> key will return to the main DCB menu.</p>

            <p>The main DCB menu offers the following controls:</p>
              <ul>

	  <section class="docs-section" id="stars-track-ownership">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Track Ownership</h2>

            <p>Controllers must both own an aircraft's track and have control of the aircraft in order to issue
              <a href="#atc-commands">instructions to the aircraft's pilot</a>. Managing ownership of tracks
              and control of an aircraft is at the core of how multiple controllers work together to
              control an aircraft; it is crucial that controllers hand off both the track and control of an
              aircraft before it enters another controller's airspace.
            </p>

            <h3 id="untracked-aircraft">Untracked Aircraft</h3>
            <p>When an aircraft departs an airport, its track and control may not be owned by any controller.
              VFR aircraft may also enter a controller's airspace without being tracked; these are known as
              <emph>unassociated</emph> tracks since there is no flight plan associated with them.
              These aircraft have a <a href="#ldb">limited datablock</a>, which only shows the aircraft's altitude in hundreds of feet.
              The datablock is drawn in green indicating that the current controller does not own it,
              and the asterisk shown in the <emph>position symbol</emph> at the center of its track (the blue dot) also indicates that its track is
              unowned.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="uncontrolled-departure.png" srcset="uncontrolled-departure-2x.png 2x" width="72" height="58">
            </div><br>
            <p>
              If an unassociated track's transponder is turned off, it appears with a plus sign
              in its position symbol and no altitude is shown; such a track is also referred to as a <emph>primary-only</emph> or
              primary track, since no secondary information is returned by its transponder.
              If its transponder is on but it is not squawking altitude, a diamond is used for its position symbol. 
              Here are some examples.
              </p>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div><br>
            <p>Departures contact the appropriate controller on the radio once they're a few hundred feet off the ground;
              look for a message in the input window below the STARS scope:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div><br>
            <p>For departures, you may disable  the "Auto track departures" checkbox
              in the "Settings" window to not automatically initiate track on the departing aircraft that you are
              responsible for in the current scenario.
            </p>
            <p>When you own an aircraft's track, the datablock becomes white a <a href="#fdb">full datablock</a>
              and the letter corresponding to your position's TCP (here, "G") will appear at the center of the radar track.</p>

              <img src="owned-track.gif" srcset="owned-track-2x.gif 2x" width="127" height="61" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Note that you can not issue control instructions to an aircraft unless it is on your radio
              frequency. If you track a departure before it contacts you, it
              is still under the tower's control and tuned to the tower's
              radio frequency.  Once the (virtual) tower controller tells the aircraft to "contact
              departure", they will check in with a message on your radio frequency. It is at this point
              that you also have control of the aircraft and can start
              issuing control commands to it.
              </p>

            <h3 id="inbound-handoffs">Inbound Handoffs</h3>

            <p>Aircraft entering your airspace will be generally owned by another controller (human or virtual) before they
              are handed off to you. Initially, they are displayed with a <a href="#pdb">partial datablock</a>
              that shows altitude in hundreds of feet, groundspeed in tens of knots, and the
              scratchpad, if set.
              Often it is a center controller who owns the aircraft and a "C" will be displayed for the position id,
              as in the example below:
              </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="center-owened-arrival.gif" srcset="center-owened-arrival-2x.gif 2x" width="127" height="61" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The controller who owns the aircraft's track may eventually hand it off to you;
              at this point, the datablock will turn white, start flashing, and change to a full datablock as shown below.

              <p>After a handoff is accepted, the aircraft's datablock will stop flashing and remain white.
              However, as with departures, you do not have control of the aircraft until the other controller
              instructs the aircraft to contact you, transferring control as well.
              After the aircraft contacts you on the radio, you may start issuing <a href="#atc-commands">control instructions</a> to it.

            <h3 id="outbound-handoffs">Outbound Handoffs</h3>

            <p>When you are ready to hand off an aircraft's track to
              another controller, a number of commands are available to do so:</p>
              <table class="table table-bordered">
                <thead>
                  <tr>

                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td><code>(CID)[SLEW]</code> / <br><code>[HND OFF](CID)[SLEW]</code> /<br> <code>[HND OFF](CID) (FLT ID)</code></td>
                    <td>Initiates a handoff of the slewed aircraft to the specified controller.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><code>[SLEW]</code>/<br><code>[HND OFF][SLEW]</code> /<br><code>[HND OFF](FLT ID)</code></td>
                    <td>Cancels an initiated handoff to another controller.
                    </td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
              <p>(For these commands, determining the correct controller ID to enter has a few
              subtleties and is discussed further below.) 
              The datablocks of outbound handoffs have an identifier for the target controller stuffed into
              the second line of the datablock, four characters in.  For JBU52 below, it is "V", corresponding
              to the intrafacility position "1V" that the aircraft is being handed off to, and for TAM9021,
              it is "C", corresponding to a center position. For handoffs outside the facility (including to center),
              the position identifier is shown in the datablock multiplexed with the altitude and scratchpad (it is "N86" for TAM9021.)
              </p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>After the other controller accepts the handoff, control of the aircraft's track is
              transferred to them. The aircraft's datablock will start
              flashing to notify you of this and the letter on the track will switch to be the
              other controller's. After a few seconds the datablock will stop flashing.
              Note that at this point you still retain control
              of the aircraft and can issue control instructions to it since you haven't yet transferred control to
              the other controller.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>When you are ready to transfer control of the aircraft to the controller who has
              accepted the track, enter the <code>FC</code> command in the command input window and slew the aircraft.
              This will instruct the aircraft to switch frequencies to the next controller.
              Clicking on the track of an aircraft that has been handed off causes the datablock
              color to switch to green; this can be used to remember that you have transferred
              communications of an aircraft to the other controller.

            <h3 id="redirecting-handoffs">Redirecting Handoffs</h3>
            
            <p>An incoming handoff can be redirected to another TCP by entering the TCP's ID and slewing the aircraft, just as if
              you owned the track and were handing it off. Doing so will add <code>RD</code> to the datablock shown to the handoff initiator
              and the redirector, and show the TCP to where the track was redirected to. This also turns the datablock green for the redirector.
              Here is a datablock for a redirected handoff as seen by the original handoff initiator; we can see that it has been
              handed off to the "X" TCP at the facility.

            <p>Redirected handoffs can be canceled using the same commands as are used for canceling regular handoffs.</p>

            <p>In addition to handing off tracks to other controllers; a controller may terminate control, otherwise known as
              "radar services terminated, frequency change approved".
              The following commands are available:</p>

            <p>Point outs let controllers direct another controller's attention to an aircraft; some facilities may have prearranged
              coordination procedures where an aircraft may pass through another controller's aircraft after a point out, or a point out

	  <section class="docs-section" id="track-information">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Track Information</h2>

            <p>Much information is encoded in the radar track symbol of an aircraft and the
              datablock displayed next to it. STARS provides many different ways to configure
              how this information is presented in an effort to balance providing the necessary
              information about aircraft that are important to a controller while minimizing the
              visual clutter from aircraft that are less relevant.</p>

            <h3 id="stars-track-symbols">Track Symbols</h3>

            <p>The location of each aircraft visible to RADAR is shown using a <i>primary target symbol</i>.
              Which shape is used for the symbol depends on which RADAR mode has been selected and which
              <a href="#stars-radar-site">RADAR sites</a> are active.
              FUSED is the default radar mode, in which case a small blue circle is used for aircraft tracks, as in the examples so far.</p>
            <p>In MULTI mode, a small blue rectangle is used in place of the circle and the rectangle is oriented
              based on the aircraft's heading; this example is flying in a northeasterly direction: 
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="track-multi.gif" srcset="track-multi-2x.gif 2x" width="148" height="77" class="img-fluid">
            </div><br>
            <p>
              In SINGLE mode, a blue rectangle is also used, but the size of the rectangle
              varies based on how close the track is to the RADAR site and the rectangle is
              oriented toward the RADAR site rather than according to the aircraft's heading.
              The track is bigger the farther
              away it is from the RADAR site, which helps show the degree of uncertainty in its position.
              SINGLE mode also includes a green line on the far side of the track with respect
              to the RADAR site's position.  This track is 50 miles from the RADAR site so has a relatively
            large rectangle, and the RADAR site is to the East, so the green line is on the left:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="track-single.gif" srcset="track-single-2x.gif 2x" width="148" height="77" class="img-fluid">
            </div><br>
            <p>In SINGLE mode, if the aircraft is very far from the RADAR site, only the outline of the blue
              rectangle is shown.</p>
            <p>The brightness of track symbols is controlled using "PRI" in the DCB BRITE menu.</p>
            
            <h4 id="stars-track-ids-history">Track History</h4>

            <p>STARS can draw a trail of small purple circles behind a track to show its prior path.
              The number of circles drawn and the time between adding a new circle to the trail is set
              using the HISTORY and H_RATE buttons in the auxiliary DCB:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="history-dcb.png" srcset="history-dcb-2x.png 2x" width="75" height="75">
            </div><br>
            <p>HISTORY sets the number of history dots; it may range from 0 to 10.
              Here is a track with a full complement of 10 history dots:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="history-10.png" srcset="history-10-2x.png 2x" width="177" height="114">
            </div><br>
            <p>H_RATE sets the time in seconds before STARS tries to add another history dot.
              Note that after this time passes, STARS does not immediately add another dot; rather, it waits
              until the next RADAR position is received for the aircraft. Under FUSED RADAR mode, positions
              are received every second, and under MULTI and SINGLE modes they are received every 5 seconds.
              Thus, for example, under FUSED mode with a H_RATE of 4.5, a new history dot is added every 5 seconds:
              STARS waits 4.5 seconds since adding the previous dot, which by definition occurred when a new
              RADAR position was received. When the next arrives in 0.5 more seconds, a dot is added, leading
              to a 5 second overall rate.</p>
            <p>The brightness of track symbols is controlled with "HST" in the DCB BRITE menu.</p>

            <h3 id="stars-position-symbols">Position Symbols</h3>

            <p>All tracks have a single-character <i>position symbol</i> at
              their center that indicates which controller owns the track.
              Position symbols are determined as follows:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If the track is owned by a controller in the current controller's facility, the
                  controller's sector ID is used. (For example, if <code>N4P</code> is the current
                  controller's TCP, an aircraft controlled by <code>N1V</code> would be shown with an "V".</li>
                <li>If the track is owned by a terminal controller in an adjacent facility, the facility
                  id is shown.</li>
                <li>If the track is owned by an enroute controller, either "C" or the enroute facility ID is shown.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>The brightness of track symbols is controlled using "POS" in the DCB BRITE menu.</p>

            <p>For unassociated primary tracks that are not squawking altitude, the triangle that is
              normally drawn for their position symbol can be disabled.</p>

              are then displayed with different position symbols than the usual.
              By default, all 12xx beacon codes are handled this way.
              In that case, aircraft not squawking altitude are drawn with a triangle position symbol and those that
              are are drawn with a square.

            <h3 id="stars-datablock-types">Datablock Types</h3>

            <p>There are three datablock formats that may be used, depending on circumstances: limited datablocks (LDBs),
              partial datablocks (PDBs), and full datablocks (FDBs)s.
              </p>

            <h4 id="ldb">Limited Datablocks (LDBs)</h4>
            <p>Limited datablocks are shown when a target is not tracked by a TCP.
              By default, they only display the altitude's altitude in hundreds of feet, though if the track
              is slewed, they display the aircraft's assigned squawk code and groundspeed for a short period of time.

            <p>If a departing aircraft is squawking a non-1200 code but there is no flight plan for the
              code they are squawking, a flashing "WHO" is displayed in their LDB next to the code they are squawking:</p>

            <h4 id="pdb">Partial Datablock (PDBs)</h4>
            <p>Partial Datablocks are associated datablocks that are owned by another controller.
              They show the aircraft's altitude and groundspeed (in tens of knots), followed by a letter indicating
              its consolidated wake turbulence (CWT) category; see <a href="#cwt">below</a> for more information about CWT.
                The altitude may alternate with the aircraft's scratchpad or destination airport, as in the example below:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="pdb-basic.gif" srcset="pdb-basic-2x.gif 2x" width="138" height="69" class="img-fluid">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Some STARS facilities use variations on the above PDB format: they may also include the secondary
              scratchpad, time-share the aircraft type with the groundspeed and CWT category, not include the groundspeed,
              or show the groundspeed and CWT category separately.</p>
            <p>Slewing a PDB converts it to a full datablock; a second slew returns it to a PDB.</p>

            <h4 id="fdb">Full Datablock (FDBs)</h4>

            <p>Full datablocks provide the most information about aircraft; at minimum, they show the aircraft identifier
              (i.e., its callsign), its altitude in hundreds of feet, its groundspeed in tens of knots, a letter denoting
              its CWT category, and the aircraft type.  Groundspeed and CWT category alternate with the aircraft type, as shown here:

            <br>
            <p>Various other information may be present in a FDB. Here we see the primary scratchpad "L30" and the secondary
              scratchpad "DEP" alternating with the altitude, where a "+" after "DEP" indicates that the secondary scratchpad
              is shown. We also see a temporary controller-assigned altitude of 12,000 feet indicated by "A120" in the third line.

              <li>The track is being handed off from another controller to the current controller.</li>
              <li>The track is a redirected handoff where the current controller has either redirected it or had it redirected to them.</li>
              <li>Another controller has pointed out the track to the current controller and the point out hasn't been cleared.</li>
              <li>The user has clicked on a track owned by another controller.</li>
              <li>The track is owned by a controller whose sector id the user has <a href="#stars-quicklook">quicklooked</a>.</li>

            <h4>"Beaconator"</h4>

            <p>The "beaconator" feature is enabled by holding the <code>Control</code> and <code>F1</code> keys on the keyboard. In full datablocks,
              it causes the aircraft id to be replaced with the code the aircraft is squawking. Partial datablocks show the sqwawk
              code in the first line, and limited datablocks show the squawk code and aircraft id. Here is an example of all

            <h3 id="additional-datablock-entries">Additional Datablock Entries</h3>

            <p>A number of additional useful pieces of information can be found in datablocks, depending on the circumstances.
              (See also the section on <a href="#flight-plans">STARS Flight Plans</a> for information
              about a number of things such as scratchpads and altitude assignments that appear in datablocks

            </p>
            
            <h4>Ident</h4>

            <p>If a controller has instructed an aircraft to ident, a flashing "ID" will appear in its datablock.
              In FDBs, "ID" replaces the CWT category next to the airspeed and the aircraft type is temporarily
              no longer displayed.  LDBs display the aircraft's squawk code and "ID" for identing aircraft,
              and PDBs display "ID" at the end of the second line of the datablock.

            <h4>Squawk Codes</h4>

            <p>If an aircraft is not squawking the beacon code assigned to it, the bottom line of the full datablock
              shows both the code it is squawking (on the left) and the code it has been assigned (on the right).
              The code that it should be squawking flashes to alert the controller.
              Slewing the aircraft makes its assigned squawk code the same as the code it is currently squawking.

            <h4>Special Purpose Codes (SPCs)</h4>

            <p>If an aircraft squawks a special purpose code (SPC) (e.g., 7600 for a radio failure, 7700 for an
              emergency, etc.), the corresponding two-letter code is shown in red at the top of the FDB and an alert sounds.
              The alert can be silenced by slewing the aircraft.
              Here is an example for an aircraft squawking 7700.

            <p>The controller may also associate an SPC with an aircraft regardless of what it is squawking by entering a
              SPC and slewing the aircraft. An alert sound is not played in this case. The following codes may be used:</p>

            <h3 id="stars-leader-lines">Leader Lines and Positioning Datablocks</h3>

            <p>Leader lines connect radar tracks to the datablocks of the associated aircraft.
              They may have eight orientations, corresponding to the eight cardinal and ordinal directions.
              Here is an example of a radar track with a leader line East of the aircraft (left) and
              Northwest of it (right):</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="leader-line-6.png" srcset="leader-line-6-2x.png 2x" width="228" height="82">

            </div><br>
            <p>The DCB offers two buttons for configuring leader lines:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-ldr.png" srcset="dcb-ldr-2x.png 2x" width="75" height="76">
            </div><br>
            <p>The top button, LDR DIR, is a spinner that controls the default direction of leader lines for
              aircraft whose tracks that are owned by the current controller.
              The bottom button, LDR, controls the length of all leader lines. The leader line length can
              range from 0 to 7, with the range of lengths shown below:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="leader-line-lengths.gif" srcset="leader-line-lengths-2x.gif 2x" width="350" height="96" class="img-fluid">
            </div><br>
            <p>A number of keyboard commands are available to specify leader lines, including ways to specify
              them for subsets of the aircraft. These all use the numbers 1-9 to specify a
              leader line direction; depending on the command, 5 may be used to clear a previously-set direction or
              it may be invalid.</p>
            <p>If you have a numeric keypad on your keyboard, you have an easy reference to
              the association between numbers and directions; consider the aircraft to be at the position of
              the "5" key and then the other numbers specify the direction of the leader line relative to the
              aircraft. If you don't have a numeric keypad, visualize one, or refer to this figure:</p>

              <h3 id="stars-quicklook">Quicklook</h3>

            <p>"Quicklook" makes it possible to specify that all tracks owned by another controller will be shown with a full datablock
              instead of a partial datablock. This can be useful when one controller is feeding aircraft to another; quicklook gives
              some more visibility into the flow of inbound aircraft. When "quicklook plus" is used, the datablocks of quicklooked aircraft
              are also shown in white rather than green. Facility engineers may also specify regions of airspace where quicklook
              automatically applies.

            <p>Dwell mode increases the brightness of the track and datablock of the aircraft closest to the mouse cursor,
              if the mouse is reasonably close to a radar track. Here is an example of it:

            <p>It can be configured using the DWELL button in the auxiliary DCB; it may take the value OFF, ON, or LOCK.
              OFF disables DWELL mode and ON enables it, with the increase in brightness lasting as long as the mouse cursor
              is close to a track. With LOCK mode, the increased brightness of a track persists, even after the mouse cursor
              moves away. Only when another track is approached by the mouse cursor does the brightness increase switch to it.

            <p>Controllers can set altitude filters to hide the datablocks and leader lines of aircraft outside a range of altitudes
              of interest; doing so can help reduce the amount of clutter on the screen.
              Here is an example of a track that is outside the filter range:</p>

            <p>Note that if an track is pointed out or is an inbound handoff, its full datablock will still be shown, even if it is outside
              of the current altitude filter.
            </p>
            <p>STARS supports two filters, one for unassociated tracks and one for associated tracks.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Flight Plans</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> offers a wide range of commands for creating flight plans on the fly for aircraft that didn't initially
              file one; the main example of this currently is VFR aircraft that call asking for flight following.
              A wide variety of are commands available to create flight plans in STARS&mdash;these are all documented in the
              following. In practice, however, it's just necessary to understand two main flows, depending on which type
              of flight plan is to be created:</p>
            <ul><li>Local Flight Plans: these are intended for flights conducted wholly within delegated airspace of the current TRACON.
                These flight plans are <emph>not</emph> sent to the host (overlying) ARTCC computer to be processed and forwarded
                "downstream" to adjacent facilities. Examples include IFR/VFR pop up requests where the flight will not exit
                the delegated airspace of the TRACON. However, <emph>local flight plans are not eligible for automated hand off to ARTCC</emph>.
                If an adjacent TRACON is adapted to accept local flight plans, then they may be transferred via automated handoff.</li>
              <li>NAS Flight Plans: these are for aircraft that will enter adjacent facility airspace, for example, VFR aircraft
                requesting radar advisories/flight following from a point within delegated TRACON airspace to a location outside of it.
                STARS users are only permitted to create VFR NAS flight plans; IFR NAS flight plans would be entered via FDIO,
                which is a separate system from STARS and not yet simulated/not needed for <i>vice</i> (for now).
                VFR aircraft on NAS flight plans are eligible for automated handoff to adjacent facilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The most common way to enter a local flight plan is to type the aircraft's callsign, a space, the type of aircraft,
              and press <code>[Enter]</code>. For example: <code>N123AB C172</code>. (Additional fields may be entered; see the
              documentation below.) A summary of the flight plan will be printed in the preview area and the flight will appear
              in the tab list ("FLIGHT PLAN"). The beacon code assigned to the aircraft can be found in either place.</p>
            <p>The usual way to create a NAS flight plan is to enter the callsign, the entry and exit fix separated by an asterisk,
              the aircraft type, and the requested altitude in hundreds of feet. Example: <code>N123AB FRG*POU C172 085</code>.
              The entry fix is usually the departure point of the aircraft or a point (VOR) near where they call for flight following
              and the exit fix is usually the VFR's destination; both must be three characters. 
              When STARS sends the a VFR NAS flight plan to the ARTCC computer and it is accepted, "VFR" is displayed to the right
              of the aircraft's callsign in the "VFR LIST". The beacon code is displayed when received from ARTCC computer a few
              seconds later. The flight also appears in the "FLIGHT PLAN" list.</p>

            <p>For the full documentation of the flight-plan related commands below, in addition to the command components defined
              above in <a href="#stars-command-entry">Entering Commands</a>,
              a few additional parameters are commonly-found in commands related to flight plans.

              the case.) Alternatively, a command is available to associate an existing flight plan with a radar track.</p>

            <h3 id="scratchpads">Scratchpads</h3>
            
            <p>In STARS, scratchpads are used to convey information to controllers&mdash;for example, the departure exit gate, or an assigned approach.
              Each aircraft has a <i>primary scratchpad</i> and a <i>secondary scratchpad</i>. Either may be set independently.
              Scratchpads are three characters by default, but may be four at some facilities. 
              They may contain letters, numbers, plus signs, periods, delta symbols, forward slashes, and asterisks, though
              they may not contain three numbers.
              The following commands can be used to manage scratchpads:</p>

                    a handoff to the controller will be initiated instead.

            <p>In PDBs and FDBs, the primary scratchpad multiplexes with the aircraft's altitude.
              The secondary scratchpad is only shown in FDBs, where it also multiplexes with the altitude and primary scratchpad, if set;
              it also has a plus sign
              displayed after it in the datablock. In the example below, the aircraft has "I2L" for its primary scratchpad and "SS"
              for its second.

            <p>The terminal proximity alert (TPA) and automated TPA (ATPA) tools provide graphical representations that aid
              in ensuring that there is sufficient separation between aircraft. A TPA cone can be associated with an aircraft
              to show a given distance in nautical miles in front of it; see the left image below for a TPA cone marking 4nm.
              A TPA J-ring is a circle around an aircraft's radar track of specified radius; the right image below shows a J-ring
              with a 4nm radius.

            <p>ATPA automatically generates cones for aircraft in the <i>approach volume</i> for a runway.
              (Approach volumes are generally along the glideslope for a runway.) For example, the image below
              shows a 5nm cone in front of BAW6895, indicating the required separation for a CWT F-class aircraft (upper large) behind an upper-heavy
              B-class aircraft.
              The current in-trail distance, 4.55nm, is shown in BAW6895's datablock, and both that distance and the cone are red, indicating
              an ATPA alert for loss of separation.

              If PLACE RR is clicked, then the next location clicked on the radar scope will become the range rings' center point.
              Finally, clicking RR CNTR causes the range rings to be centered on the point at the center of the radar scope;
              If the range rings are not currently centered, RR CNTR is drawn depressed.

            <p>The Converging Runways Display Aid (CRDA) helps ensure separation between aircraft approaching

            <p>Here four aircraft are approaching KPHL, AAL45 and JZA868 landing runway 27R and JIA1524 and FFT5099 landing runway 17.
              With CRDA enabled, ghosts of the aircraft landing 27R are drawn on the runway 17 approach course at the same distance out
              as they are from the point where the two runways intersect.
              If we compare the separation of AAL45's ghost with FFT5099, we can see that there will be adequate
              separation between the two aircraft&mdash;FFT5099 will be well past where the runways intersect before AAL45 lands.
              It's a little tighter with JZA868 and JIA1524, though CRDA might give us the hint to slow down JZA868 to increase distance between them.
              </p>
            <p>Ghost aircraft may be positioned via either "stagger" or "tie" mode.  With stagger mode, the ghosts
              are the same difference from a common point (e.g., the intersection of two runways); the controller's
              goal is then to ensure adequate separation between ghost and actual aircraft radar tracks.
              Alternatively, with tie mode, ghosts are offset so that the controller's goal is to have actual
              aircraft radar tracks coincide with the ghost tracks in order to achieve separation.</p>
            <p>When CRDA is available at an airport, the CRDA status list may be displayed on the STARS scope. 
              Entering <code>[MULTIFUNC]TN</code> toggles whether it is shown, and <code>[MULTIFUNC]TN[SLEW]</code>
              repositions it on the screen. In the example below, we can see from the "S" in the line two below "CRDA STATUS"
              that CRDA is enabled in stagger mode for
              runways 27R/17 at KPHL for the current controller, who has ID 6F.</p>

            <p>In the restriction area commands, <code>(RATEXT)</code> is used to indicate specification of the text
              associated with the restriction area. One or two lines of text may be specified; if a second line is
              given, it should be separated from the first by a space. Because space is used to separate lines, periods
              must be entered for spaces within a line of text. These periods are converted to spaces by <i>vice</i>.</p>
            <p>Depending on the context, a third line with additional qualifiers can be entered: <code>∆</code> to indicate
              that the text should blink and <code>+</code> to indicate that its associated shape should be shaded,
              or <code>*</code> followed by a number from 1&mdash;8 to specify a color for the graphics. Here are the colors

            <p><code>(RALOC)</code> corresponds to specifying a location.
              One way to do so is by clicking a point in the STARS window;
              alternatively, the names of a fix, a fix offset by a given distance in a given direction, or a latitude-longitude
              coordinate may be provided. If keyboard entry is used, <code>[ENTER]</code> must be pressed after each location.
              Here are a few examples of text input:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>CCC</code>: specifies that the location of the CCC VOR should be used.</li>
              <li><code>CCC/320/2.5</code>: specifies a point 2.5nm miles along the 320 bearing from the CCC VOR.</li>
              <li><code>403758N/0734617W</code>: specifies a latitude-longitude coordinate 40.37.58N, 73.46.17W.
                In other words, for latitude, the first two digits are degrees, the next two are minutes, and the next two
                are seconds, followed by a "N" or an "S". For longitude, three digits are used for degrees (and leading
                0s must be used if necessary), then two digits for each of minutes and seconds, followed by "W" or "E".
                Latitude and longitude coordinates are separated by a slash <code>/</code>.</li>
              </ul>
            <p>Putting all of the above together, the a restriction area above that is a 2nm circle around KFRG might be created
              by <code>[F12]C2 REPUBLIC FRG[ENTER][ENTER]</code>. We could instead make a shaded area with two lines of flashing by
              entering <code>[F12]C2 REPUBLIC SHADED.AREA +∆ FRG[ENTER][ENTER]</code>. Here is the result:

              <i>vice</i> is able to indicate when aircraft are outside of the departure or approach airspace,
              if it has information about the airspace boundaries.
              (This information is not available at all airports.)
              If an aircraft is outside of its assigned airspace, a red "AS" error will be printed at the
              top of its datablock, as shown below.
              The valid altitudes for the aircraft are shown as well, if there are any valid altitudes
              at its current location.
              For example, the aircraft below is at 5,000' but should be between 11,000' and 12,000' (or should be at a different location!)

            <h3 id="stars-range-center">Range and Center</h3>

            <p>The left side of the main DCB has a few buttons for controlling the range of the STARS scope
              and where it is centered:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-range-center.png" srcset="dcb-range-center-2x.png 2x" width="151" height="75">
            </div><br>
            <p>Clicking on RANGE activates the range spinner, which allows setting the scope range to be between
              6 and 256 nautical miles. The center of the scope can be changed by clicking PLACE CNTR;
              moving the mouse moves the scope accordingly. Click a second time when you're happy with the
              scope's position. Finally, OFF CNTR is shown as depressed when the scope's center is
              different than the default center specified in the scenario configuration. Clicking on it
              restores the center to the default.
              </>

            <p>Alternatively, center of the radar scope can be moved by
            clicking the right mouse button and dragging.  Zoom in and out
            using the mouse wheel; each step increases or decreases the
            radius shown by one nautical mile.  Holding down the control
            key while using the mouse wheel gives three mile steps in the
            radius.  Zooming and panning the scope in this way can be disabled
            with <i>vice</i>'s settings window, which is displayed when
            the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> in the menubar is clicked.

            <h3 id="stars-radar-site">RADAR Sites</h3>

            <p>The STARS RADAR configuration can be
              managed by clicking the SITE button in the main DCB, which also shows the current RADAR mode.
              STARS supports three RADAR modes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>SINGLE: RADAR data from a single RADAR site is used determine aircraft locations.</li>
              <li>MULTI: multiple RADAR sites are used to determine aircraft locations, where (more or less),
                the closest site to each aircraft is used.</li>
              <li>FUSED: RADAR data from multiple sites is combined with <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/technology/adsb">ADS-B</a>
                data from aircraft to determine their locations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SINGLE mode can be selected by clicking on a radar site in the SITE DCB sub-menu (here, NXX and PHL are available.)
              MULTI and FUSED are selected by clicking on the corresponding buttons.</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-radar.png" srcset="dcb-radar-2x.png 2x" width="665" height="80" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;">
            </div><br>
            <p>Note that the choice of RADAR mode affects <a href="#stars-track-symbols">which symbols are used for tracks in STARS</a>.
              Furthermore, in SINGLE and MULTI modes, radar tracks are only updated once every 5 seconds. In FUSION mode, they are
              updated once per second.</p>

            <h3 id="audio-alerts">Audio</h3>

            <p>Audio alerts are played when there is a minimum safe altitude warning for an aircraft,
              if an aircraft is squawking a special purpose code (e.g., 7700 for an emergency),
              it a SPC has been manually assigned to an aircraft, or if there is a conflict alert between
              two aircraft.  The "VOL" control in the main DCB can be used to control the volume of these alerts.
            </p>
            <p>A few keyboard commands can be used to control audio:</p>
              <table class="table table-bordered">
                <thead>
                  <tr>

                    <th style="width: 75%;">Function</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td><code>[MULTIFUNC]ZA</code></td>
                    <td>Briefly plays the audio test sound.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><code>[MULTIFUNC]ZEE</code></td>

                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><code>[MULTIFUNC]ZEI</code></td>
                    <td>Inhibits audio alerts when an invalid command is entered.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            <p><i>vice</i> also provides optional audio alerts for when there is an inbound handoff to the
              current controller and when an outbound handoff is accepted (though real-world STARS does not have
              these.)  These alerts can be enabled and disabled under the "STARS" section of <i>vice</i>'s settings menu.</p>

            <h3 id="stars-preferences">Preferences</h3>

            <p>Various details of the current STARS configuration like brightness settings, font sizes, and the layout
              of the system lists can be saved in a STARS preference set.
              The current preference set stores the preference settings that are currently active, and up to 32
              additional named preference sets can be stored.
              <i>vice</i> stores separate preferences for each TRACON, which makes it easy to customize STARS's settings
              in different ways for different facilities.
              </p>

            <p>Functionality for loading and saving preference sets can be accessed by clicking PREF on the main DCB menu,
              which brings up the PREF menu:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-prefs.png" srcset="dcb-prefs-2x.png 2x" width="1656" height="83" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;">
            </div><br>            
            <p>Here we can see that there are two saved preference sets, PHLN and FINAL, and that FINAL is active.
              Clicking on a saved preference set selects it and loads its settings.
              Preferences can be restored to their defaults by clicking on DEFAULT.
              Clicking RESTORE restores the preferences to what they were when the PREF button was clicked to bring up the PREF DCB menu.
              If a preference set is selected, then SAVE is enabled; clicking on it
              saves the current preference settings to the selected preference set.
              DELETE deletes the selected preference set.</p>
            <p>A new preference set is created when SAVE AS is clicked: the preview area will prompt PREF SET NAME and
              the name for the preference set can be entered, followed by the <code>ENTER</code> key.
              Preference set names may be up to 7 alphanumeric characters and may not be a number between 1
              and 32.</p>
            <p>These keyboard commands are available for preference sets:</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Display Elements</h2>

            <p>In addition to radar tracks and their datablocks, the STARS display contains 
              various <i>system lists</i> that display useful text information,
              <i>video maps</i> of the local control area, and, optionally,
              a weather radar showing precipitation. These are all described in this section.</p>

            <h3 id="stars-system-lists">System Lists</h3>
            <p>The system lists show various types of useful information in the form of text.  Their font size can be adjusted using the "LISTS" control in the "CHAR SIZE" DCB menu and their brightness is set with "LST" in the "BRITE" DCB menu. 
            </p>
            <p><i>vice</i> currently doesn't support two STARS system
              lists: the VFR List and the Coast/Suspend List; both will be added in the
              future when the aircraft simulation supports VFR and lost radar
              tracks. Otherwise, all of the system lists other than ones for CRDA and maps are
              documented in this section; see the <a href="#crda">CRDA documentation
                above</a> for information about the CRDA system list and <a href="#stars-video-maps">Video Maps</a>
              for information about the maps system list.</p>

            <h4 id="stars-ssa-list">System Status Area List</h4>
            <p>The System Status Area (SSA) list displays general information about the configuration of the STARS radar scope. Here is an example:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="ssa-system-list.png" srcset="ssa-system-list-2x.png 2x" width="209" height="128">
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>The red triangle indicates that STARS is functioning correctly; in <i>vice</i> it will always be there. The first line of text shows the current zulu time 03:07:27 and the altimeter at the primary airport for the current scenario, PHL. The following line shows the network status (always "OK/OK/NA" in <i>vice</i>) as well as the current radar mode, FUSED. Next is the current range shown from the scope's center, 17nm, and the length of predicted track lines (PTLs), 0.5 minutes. Next are the altitude filters, first for unassociated tracks and then for associated tracks (both in hundreds of feet.) The next few line again shows the altimeter at PHL and contains the altimeters at nearby airports in multi-airport scenarios.</p>
            <p>A few lines are only shown when corresponding features are enabled. Here, "QL: 6S" indicates that TCP 6S has been <a href="#quicklook">quicklooked</a> and "TW OFF: MSAW" indicates that <a href="#stars-msaw">MSAW</a> has been disabled system-wide.  Finally, we can see that <a href="#crda">CRDA</a> has been enabled for the runway pair 27R/17, with the "S" indicating "stagger" mode.</p>
            <p>The SSA list is always visible; a keyboard command is
            available to position it:</p>

            <h4>Flight Plan List</h4>

            <p>The flight plan list shows flight plans that are not yet associated with aircraft and
              that you will be responsible for when they do. (This includes both future arrivals and
              departures.)
              Once they are associated with aircraft, flight plans are automatically removed from the list. Here is an example:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="flight-plan-list.png" srcset="flight-plan-list-2x.png 2x" width="289" height="184">
            </div><br>
            <p>Each line includes the flight's <i>tab list id</i>, a two-digit number that can be used to
              refer to the flight plan with STARS commands, the aircraft's callsign,
              the assigned beacon code (right column), the aircraft's final altitude in hundreds of feet,
              and one letter indicating the arrival/departure fixes.
            </p>
            <p>The flight plan list can be managed with these commands:</p>
            <table class="table table-bordered">

            <h4>Tower List</h4>

            <p>The tower list shows arrivals at an airport. Up to three tower lists can be displayed; each show arriving aircraft sorted by their distance to the airport.  The assignment of airports to tower lists is done by the facility engineer in the scenario specification and can't be changed while <i>vice</i> is running. Here is an example, showing a few arrivals to PHL:</p>

            <br>
            <p>The following commands can be used to configure the tower lists. For all of them the first number gives the tower list index and must be 1, 2, or 3.</p>

            <p>The Alert List shows the aircraft that currently have altitudes below the minimum vectoring altitude at their present position (LA) or have collision alerts (CA). Below we see that JZA868 is too low (and is currently at 600 feet altitude) and that separation has been lost between JIA1524 and NKS9096.</p>

            <h4 id="coordination-lists">Coordination Lists</h4>

            <p>Coordination lists are used for tower and departure controllers to coordinate aircraft releases.
              When there is a departure ready to be released from an airport the controller is responsible for, it is added
              to the coordination list by the tower controller. After the departure controller releases an aircraft,
              it will depart within the next few minutes. Here is an example coordination list:</p> 
            <div class="text-center">

            <p>Aircraft that are awaiting release flash, as DPJ7156 is here.  Released aircraft are no longer flashing and have
              a plus sign after their tab list number (here, 0 and 2 for EJA5253 and LXJ13, respectively.)
              The coordination list also includes the aircraft type, the aircraft's assigned squawk code, its exit, and
              its requested final altitude.</p>

            <h3 id="stars-video-maps">Video Maps</h3>

            <p>One or more <i>video maps</i> may be displayed in the STARS window to show items like airports and runways, approaches,
              important fixes, and geographical features like bridges. There are default video maps specified for each control position
              and controllers may add an remove maps depending on circumstances.</p>
            <p>The main DCB includes a MAPS button, which displays the DCB MAPS menu, and six buttons to toggle the display of six
              video maps; here are six from a KJFK scenario:</p> 
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="dcb-maps-main.png" srcset="dcb-maps-main-2x.png 2x" width="333" height="82">
            </div><br>
            <p>The button for map number 849, CLASS_B, is depressed, indicating that the corresponding map (which shows the
              class B airspace) is currently visible.  The other maps are not currently displayed. Clicking on map's button
              toggles whether it is visible.</p>
            <p>Here is the MAPS DCB menu for that same scenario:</p>
              <div class="text-center">
                <img src="dcb-maps-menu.png" srcset="dcb-maps-menu-2x.png 2x" width="1493" height="84" style="max-width: 100%; height:auto;">
              </div><br>
            <p>The map labeled 4L_R which has number 201, is currently visible, though none of the others are.
              Each map is in one of two map groups&mdash;A or B; the brightness of the groups is controlled by MPA and MPB in the
              <a href="#stars-brightness">BRITE DCB menu</a>. Unfortunately, STARS doesn't directly show which group a particular map is in.</p>
            <p>The other buttons in the MAPS DCB do the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>DONE: returns to the main menu.</li>
              <li>CLR ALL: deselects all video maps.</li>
              <li>GEO MAPS: toggles display of the maps system list and shows the available video maps in it.</li>
              <li>SYS PROC: toggles display of the maps system list and shows maps related to STARS system operation (e.g., CRDA regions, ATPA volumes, RADAR site ranges, etc.) in it.</li>
              <li>CURRENT: toggles display of the maps system list and shows the currently displayed maps in it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on which maps have been included, there may be buttons for the following map categories;
              when pressed, they cause the corresponding type of available maps to be shown in the maps system list:
              AIRPORT, CONTROL, DANGER AREAS, GENERAL AV, GEO POINTS, MIL, RUNWAYS, and SID STAR.</p>
            <p>Here is the maps system list for that same KJFK scenario. For each map, we have the map number, the map label (as shown in the DCB),
              and a longer name describing the map's contents. Maps that are currently displayed have &gt; symbols next to them.

            <h3 id="stars-weather">Weather</h3>

            <p>The current weather radar that shows precipitation can be
              displayed on the STARS scope. Here is an example North of KORD
              during some summer thunderstorms.
              The blue-green areas indicate light precipitation, while the mustard-colored area is moderate to heavy precipitation.
              Stippling in the radar also indicates the strength, where a denser stipple is heavier precipitation.</p>
            <div class="text-center">

            <p>AWI8111 would be well-advised to turn a few degrees to the
              right.</p>
            
            <p>The brightness of the weather on the STARS scope can be controlled using the "WX" spinner in the BRITE menu of the DCB
              and the brightness of the stipple is controlled using the "WXC" BRITE control.
              It is also possible to control which levels of precipitation are shown using the "WX*" buttons in the main DCB.
              When precipitation of a given level is available to be displayed, "AVL" is shown in the button and the button has
              a blue-grey color. When there is no precipitation at a level, the corresponding button has the regular green color.
            </p>

            <p>With the selection above, the three lowest levels, WX1 and WX2 are not shown, while all of the higher levels
              of precipitation are.</p>

            <p>If the WX button in the <a href="#stars-ssa-list">SSA list</a> is enabled, the currently available
              WX levels and whether they are displayed is shown in the SSA list. In the example below, there is
              precipitation at levels 1&ndash;5, though not 6. Levels 3, 4, and 5 are shown in the STARS window:</p>

              <p>All of the configuration of <i>vice</i> is via JSON-formatted files.
                Extending <i>vice</i> to include more airports or additional scenarios is a matter
                of generating additional JSON that provides the necessary information.
              </p>
              <p>In the following, the use of terms like "element", "object", "member", "array", etc.,
                correspond to their use in the JSON specification.  See <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">this page</a> for reference.
                </p>
              <p>See the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/scenarios"><code>resources/scenarios/</code> directory</a> in the 
                  vice source code for the scenarios that are currently available and the
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/videomaps"><code>resources/videomaps/</code> directory</a> for
                the video map definitions.
                Files in those directories with names ending with a "zst" suffix have been compressed using <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/">zstandard</a>;
                in order to examine their contents, you'll want to install zstandard or another decompression program that supports that
                format.
              </p>
              <p>When developing scenarios, you might make a copy of an existing scenario's JSON file and modify it in order to add more configurations,
                or you or might specify completely new scenario and video map files if you're working on support for a new TRACON.
                While you're doing this you can point <i>vice</i> at the
                file you're working on using the command-line: if you open a command prompt and run <i>vice</i> from the command line,
                  there are two options make it possible to specify
                additional files for testing:
                </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The <code>-scenario</code> command line option takes a single filename.
                  The scenario specified file is loaded at startup time; if it has the same name as an existing scenario, it replaces
                  that scenario's definition.
                </li>
                <li>In a similar manner, the <code>-videomap</code> command line option also takes a single filename that specifies a file
                  with video map definitions.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>When you're working on a new scenario, you may omit the "video_map_file" specifier in its JSON file.
                In this case, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the video map file you specified via <code>-videomap</code>
                or via the UI.
              </p>
              <p>If you're working on multi-controller support for a
              scenario, you may want to run a <i>vice</i> server locally to
                debug it. A few command-line options are useful:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>-runserver</code> launches a <i>vice</i> server on
                your local system</li>
                <li><code>-server</code> specifies the IP address and
                  (optionally), the port of a <i>vice</i>
                  server to connect to. Specifying <code>localhost</code>

            <p>Throughout the <i>vice</i> configuration files, it's often necessary to specify various locations on the Earth.
              <i>vice</i> has a built-in database of all of the airports, VORs, NDBs, and fixes in the United States (courtesy of the FAA),
              which allows using these directly for specifying locations. The locations of runway thresholds are available via the syntax
              <code>KJFK-22L</code> where the airport name and runway specifier are separated by a hyphen.</p>

              <p>Locations can also be specified via
              latitude-longitude positions, given as strings. For convenience, multiple latitude-longitude formats are supported.

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-routes">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Routes</h2>

            <p>When an aircraft's route is given, <i>vice</i> allows airways to be used to describe the route,
              which simplifies the route specification when an aircraft is in fact flying along an airway.
              Airways are given as part of the route; for example "WHITE V1 DPK" has the aircraft join V1
              departing WHITE and follow V1 until DPK. (The alternative, "WHITE DIXIE MOVFA JFK DPK", is
              more typing and more error-prone to enter.)</p>
              
            <p><i>vice</i> uses a custom syntax for specifying the routes of aircraft that allows giving
              additional information that is used in the simulation.
              In addition to the lateral positions along the route, it is possibly to specify speed and altitude restrictions, handoff points,
              and headings to fly.
            </p>
            <p>Here is an example route from a JFK departure. The first two fixes along the departure runway are automatically
              provided by <i>vice</i> so the route starts with the specified fixes in the departure procedure.
              The "/h223" after "RNGRR" specifies that the aircraft should fly a 223 heading as departing RNGRR.
              It will maintain that heading until it
              is further vectored by the controller.  If there are further fixes after such a heading, the aircraft may be sent direct to one of
              those fixes by the controller.</p>
            <pre>
  "SKORR METSS RNGRR/h223"
            </pre>
            <p>A variety of such things can be specified along with a fix:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>/a</code><i>restriction</i>: for IFR routes, cross the fix with the specified altitude restriction
                (with altitudes specified in 100s of feet). For VFR, aircraft will be at a random altitude within a given
                altitude range.
                The following options are available for specifying altitude restrictions:
                <ul>
                  <li><i>low</i><code>-</code><i>high</i>: cross at an altitude between <i>low</i> and <i>high</i>.</li>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>-</code>: cross at or below <i>alt</i>.</li>
                  <li><i>alt</i><code>+</code>: cross at or above <i>alt</i>.</li>
                  <li><i>alt</i>: cross at <i>alt</i>.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> <code>/delete</code>: the aircraft will be deleted when it reaches the fix</li>
              <li> <code>/h</code><i>heading</i>: depart the fix at specified heading</li>
              <li> <code>/iaf</code>: indicates that the fix is an IAF (initial approach fix)</li>
              <li> <code>/if</code>: indicates that the fix is the IF (intermediate fix)</li>
              <li> <code>/faf</code>: indicates that the fix is the FAF (final approach fix). This must be specified for one fix in each approach.</li>
              <li> <code>/flyover</code>: indicates that the fix is a <i>flyover</i> fix (as opposed to the
                default, <i>fly-by</i>). Aircraft must pass directly over flyover
                fixes before turning to the next fix, while they may turn early with fly-by fixes.</li>
              <li> <code>/ph</code><i>heading</i>: fly present heading (rounded to the nearest 5 degree increment) departing the fix.</li>
              <li> <code>/s</code><i>speed</i>: cross the fix at the given speed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A number of specifiers are intended for ambient traffic that's not under the control for a human:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>/clearapp</code>: the aircraft will be cleared for the assigned approach passing the fix.</li>
              <li> <code>/ho</code>: the aircraft should be handed off from the virtual controller when it passes the fix.
                A TCP may be specified after <code>/ho</code>, in which case the aircraft is handed off to the
                corresponding virtual controller. If no TCP is specified, the aircraft is handed off to the
                appropriate human controller.
              </li>
              <li> <code>/tc</code>: "transfer comms": after passing a <code>/ho</code> fix, normally aircraft call in
                a few seconds after the human controller accepts the handoff.  However, if <code>/tc</code> is specified
                at a later fix in the route, they won't contact the controller until reaching that fix.</li>
              <li> <code>/po</code><i>TCP id</i>: when the aircraft passes the fix
                and if it is under the control of a virtual controller,
                issue a point out to the controller identified by the given TCP id (i.e., the
                controller ID that would be used when doing a point out in STARS.)</li>
              <li> <code>/radius</code><i>num</i>: rather than flying precisely to the fix, the aircraft will fly to
                a random point within <i>num</i> miles of the fix.</li>
              <li> <code>/shift</code><i>num</i>: rather than flying precisely to the fix, the aircraft will fly along
                the route to the fix but will turn for the next fix at a random distance before or after the fix,
                up to num/2 nautical miles in each direction.</li>
              <li> <code>/spsp</code><i>scratchpad</i>: sets the aircraft's primary scratchpad to the given value.</li>
              <li> <code>/sssp</code><i>scratchpad</i>: sets the aircraft's secondary scratchpad to the given value.</li>
              <li> <code>/cpsp</code>: clears the aircraft's primary scratchpad</li>
              <li> <code>/cssp</code>: clears the aircraft's secondary scratchpad</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition to <code>/radius</code> and <code>/shift</code>, which are also useful for randomizing VFR
              routes, there's an additional specifier that can be used with VFR aircraft routes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>/airwork</code>: the aircraft should perform airwork
                centered around the fix. An altitude restriction must be specified using <code>/a</code> to give an altitude
                range for the airwork. By default, they will do so for 15 minutes and remain within 7nm of the fix;
                alternatively, the time or distance may be specified via <code>/airwork</code><i>radius</i><code>nm</code>
                and/or  <code>/airwork</code><i>minutes</i><code>m</code>. For example: <code>/airwork30m10nm</code>
                specifies 30 minutes of airwork within a 10nm radius of the fix.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the aircraft should follow an arc leaving a
              fix, <code>/arc</code> can be given after the fix.
              It can be used in two ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Both a radius in nautical miles as well as the fix at the
              center of the arc's circle can be specified.  For
              example, <code>HANAV/arc16OMN</code> specifies a 16nm radius
                arc centered at <code>OMN</code>.</li>
              <li>Alternatively, just the length of the arc may be given.
                For example, <code>WUPMA/arc7.5 ALABE</code> has aircraft fly along the 7.5nm long arc between WUPMA and ALABE.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For both uses, the direction of the arc is
              automatically determined based on the position of the following fix.
              </p>
            <p>For approach fixes that have procedure turns, a number of additional items can be specified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>/hilpt</code>: there is a hold in lieu of procedure turn (i.e., a racetrack procedure turn) associated with the fix.
                The default is right turns and a 1 minute limit for ILS/VOR/LOC approaches and a 4 nm limit for RNAV approaches.
                Different limits can be specified directly; for example <code>/hilpt6nm</code> gives a procedure turn with a 6 nm limit and
                <code>/hilpt2min</code> specifies a 2 minute limit.  For left turns, add a <code>l</code> after the slash, like
                <code>/lhilpt</code>.</li>
              <li><code>/pt45</code>: specifies that there is a standard 45 degree procedure turn at the fix. (This has the same defaults&mdash;
                right turns, 1 minute (ILS/VOR/LOC) / 4 nm (RNAV)&mdash;as HILPTs. Alternative values are specified the same way.)</li>
              <li><code>/pta</code><i>altitude</i>: if the aircraft should descend during the procedure turn, this can be used to specify
              the final altitude it should have at the end of the turn. (The altitude should be given in 100s of feet.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt180</code>: specifies that aircraft approaching the fix in the 180 degree semicircle of directions aligned
                with the final approach course should not perform the procedure turn. (As an example, see the <a href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2409/05570RZ8.PDF">KJAX RNAV Z 8</a> approach; this applies for aircraft between heading 346 and 166
              arriving at UDAQI.)</li>
              <li><code>/nopt</code>: when specified at a fix prior to one with a procedure turn, indicates that aircraft that
              pass that fix should not fly the procedure turn.</li>
            </ul>

              For example, AAL's "long" fleet would be a good choice for trans-Atlantic flights.</p>

            <p><i>vice</i> offers users a variety of ATC scenarios, where a scenario consists of one or more airports being controlled,
              a control position (departure, approach, etc.), and airport configurations&mdash;the runways that are active at each
              airport.  Scenarios are organized in <i>scenario groups</i>, which generally collect multiple control scenarios at a single
              airport.
              Each scenario group is specified by its own JSON file; see the <a href="https://github.com/mmp/vice/tree/master/resources/scenarios"><code>resources/scenarios/</code></a> directory in the
              <i>vice</i> source code distribution for examples.

            <p>The member names in the airport "approaches" object give the abbreviated name of each approach,
            as used in <i>vice</i>'s <a href="#atc-commands">ATC commands</a>.</p>

            <p>Approaches may be specified using data automatically loaded from the

              To use CIFP data, run <i>vice</i> from the command-line and give it the argument <code>-route KXYZ</code>, where
              <code>KXYZ</code> is the ICAO code for the airport. <i>vice</i> will print identifiers for the available approaches
              and their associated fixs. For example:</p>
<pre>
  > ..\vice.exe -routes KMIA
  [...]  
  Approaches:
  I12  : DHP GLRIA/a3000+/lhilpt1.0min/pta3000/iaf PIANA/a3000+ VEPCO/a2000+

            <p>Approach ids encode the type of approach&mdash;for example, <code>I12</code> is an
ILS approach to runway 27 and <code>RY12</code> is an RNAV Y runway 12 approach.
Given the id, the approach can be specified with:</p>

          <section class="docs-section" id="fe-departures">
            <h2 class="section-heading">Departures</h2>

            <p>There are two pieces for specifying departures: their initial route leaving the airport, which depends on the active departure runway,
              and their subsequent route out of the TRACON, which does not. These two parts are specified separately.</p>
            <p>The "departure_routes" object in the airport definition gives the initial routing for departures,
              based both on the runway they are departing as well
              as their exit fix.  Here is an excerpt from the KJFK departure routes:
              </p>
            <pre>
  "departure_routes": {
    "13R": {
      "ARD,DIXIE,RBV,WHITE": {
        "cleared_altitude": 5000,
        "sid": "JFK5",
        "waypoints": "KJFK-31L/h185"
      },
      ...
            </pre>
            <p>The members of "departure_routes" are strings identifying the departure runway; each departure runway's routes
              are then represented by an object with one or more members that specify comma-separated lists of exit fixes.
              (Thus, the specification above applies to departures with
              exit ARD, DIXIE, RBV, or WHITE, departing runway 13R.)</p>
            <p>
              The exit fix specifiers may include additional text after a
              period to allow specifying situation-dependent exits.
              For example, we might specify one route
              for "RBV.PISTONS", another for "RBV.TURBOPROPS", and a third
              for "RBV.JETS".  <i>vice</i> treats all of these as going to
              the "RBV" exit.  When departures are defined in
              "departures", they can then refer to the appropriate exit in
              their "exit" specifier. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The departure route specification includes the following members:

                  specified together in the same "inbound_flow".  Similarly, if
                  multiple STARs have the same initial route, they should be
                  together as well.

            <p>STARs are sometimes able to deliver aircraft to multiple airports. Therefore, the "airlines" member
              is an object with airport names as members.  Each of the airports is associated with an array of objects
              that specify departure airports, airlines, and (optionally) airline fleets.  Here is an excerpt from the
              CAMRN4 arrival group at KJFK:
            </p>
            <pre>
  "airlines": {
    "KFRG": [
      {
        "airport": "KDCA",
        "icao": "EJA"
      },
      ...
    ],
    "KJFK": [
      {
        "airport": "MMMY",
        "fleet": "long",
        "icao": "AMX"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
            </pre>
            <p>We can see that CAMRN4 applies to both the KFRG and KJFK airports, though with different airlines
              and different departure airports for the arrivals. The specified departure airports (here, KDCA and MMMY)
              are only used so that flight strips and data blocks on the scope are realistic, but the specified airlines
              are used to select the type of aircraft from their fleets.  As elsewhere, a value for "fleet" may be specified
              to limit which types of aircraft may be chosen.
            </p>

            <p>There are two ways to specify a STAR's waypoints: automatically using data loaded from the
              <a href="https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/">FAA CIFP</a> or
              manually.  To use CIFP data, ensure that the STAR is available by running vice from the command-line
              and providing the <code>-routes KXYZ</code> argument, where <code>KXYZ</code> is the name of the
              airport.  <i>vice</i> will print the available STARS with their transitions.  For example,</p>
<pre>
> ..\vice.exe -routes KLGA
STARs:
APPLE3.SHLBK: SHLBK LOUIE/a13000 BACKY ODESA DQO RUUTH WNDYL BRAND/a8000 KORRY DEPDY TYKES MINKS JERZY RENUE APPLE PROUD/flyover/h45
APPLE3.SWANN: SWANN GATBY KERNO ODESA DQO RUUTH WNDYL BRAND/a8000 KORRY DEPDY TYKES MINKS JERZY RENUE APPLE PROUD/flyover/h45
APPLE3.ALL  : RUUTH WNDYL BRAND/a8000 KORRY DEPDY TYKES MINKS JERZY RENUE APPLE PROUD/flyover/h45
[...]
</pre>
            <p>If the STAR specified
              in the "star" parameter is present, <i>vice</i> will automatically use the available routes to define the STAR's
              transitions and runway-specific waypoints.  In that case, one additional parameter must be specified:</p>

                  A point between two waypoints in the STAR can be specified using an "@" symbol
                  and a number between 0 and 1 that represents the fraction of distance between
                  the waypoint and the next. For example, "STW@0.6" specifies that aircraft should
                  spawn 0.6 of the way between STW and the following waypoint.
                  Aircraft will then be handed off from the center controller halfway between the
                  first two waypoints of the route.

                  must match the last waypoint in "waypoints". (See the example below.)</td>

            <p>The "runway_waypoints" member can be used for STARs that have different routes depending on the arrival
              airport and runway.
              When the user instructs the aircraft to expect a particular approach then the corresponding waypoints are
              added to its route. As an example, the specification of the KPHL <a href="https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2409/00320JIIMS.PDF">JIIMS4 arrival</a>
              starts with the following string for "waypoints": "HEKMN N039.27.43.645,W074.56.38.400/ho JIIMS/a8000".
              (The second point is used to set the handoff point to be between HEKMN and JIIMS.)
              It then has the following "runway_waypoints", corresponding to the runway-specific routes into KPHL, the
              only active airport in the scenario.
              Note that all start with JIIMS, the same fix at the end of "waypoints".

            <h2 class="section-heading">VFR Aircraft</h2>

            <p><i>vice</i> allows the specification of VFR "distractor" aircraft in scenarios;
              this provides realistic extra clutter in the scope and sometimes aircraft that need to be
              accounted for when vectoring IFR aircraft.
              If "vfr_reporting_points" are specified in the <a href="#fe-scenario-groups">Scenario Group</a>,
              then VFR aircraft will periodically call asking for flight following.
              For now, <i>vice</i> ensures that VFR aircraft remain clear of B and C class airspace.
            </p>

            <p>VFR aircraft are specified using the "vfr" field in an airport's specification object in a scenario JSON file.
              They can either be specified with a specific route to fly, or it is possible to specify that they should
              fly a random route that ends up at one of the other airports that has VFR departures.
              In practice, it works well to have VFR departures both from class D and uncontrolled airports inside a TRACON but
              also from such airports up to 30-50 miles outside the TRACON; this gives good variety of both flights within
              the TRACON but also overflights, departures that land outside the TRACON, and arrivals that land within it.
              The following values can be specified in an airport's "vfr" object:
            </p>

            <p>As discussed in <a href="#fe-routes">Routes</a>, there are additional specifiers that can be included
              with VFR routes that are useful with the "routes" option; adding <code>/radius</code> to fixes along routes
              is an easy way to add randomness to VFR routes.  <code>/airwork</code> can also be used to have aircraft
              go out and do practice airwork from an airport.
            </p>
            <p>Altitude restrictions in VFR routes are also handled specially: if a range of altitudes is specified using <code>/a</code>
              at a waypoint, VFR aircraft will select a random altitude within that range.
            </p>
            <p>When defining VFR routes, it's a good idea to be mindful of class B/C airspace.
              When <i>vice</i> wants to create a VFR departure, it generates a random route, either fully on its own
              if "random_routes" is used, or using the route given in "waypoints" if "routes" is used.
              It then simulates the aircraft's flight and checks to see if it enters B/C airspace.
              If it does, it discards the route and generates a new one.
              It keeps doing this until it finds a valid route, but eventually it will give up if it's not being successful.
              Thus, feel free to define routes that are close to the boundaries of such airspace, but give <i>vice</i>
              some space to work with via <code>/radius</code> and altitude ranges so that it has a chance of finding a valid route.
            </p>
            <p>Two other useful tools when working on VFR: in the STARS scope, if you type <code>.VFR</code> and
              press enter, <i>vice</i> will show all of the VFR departure airports by drawing a circle around their location
              and displaying their name. Entering <code>.VFR</code> again hides them.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
              <img src="vfr-airport-stars.png" srcset="vfr-airport-stars-2x.png 2x" width="109" height="65">
            </div><br>            
            <p>Second, if you enter <code>.DRAWROUTE</code> in the STARS scope, you can click on a series of points to define
              a route. After each click, the clipboard is updated to have the lat-long coordinates of the entire
              route. Pressing <code>[Backspace]</code> removes the last point from the route.
              Here is an example of specifying a route along the south shore of Long Island and then North
              along the Hudson River for a N90 scenario.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Controller Airspace</h2>

            <p>Airspace volumes representing areas that particular controllers are responsible for may optionally be specified
              using the "airspace" object in the scenario group. If specified, <i>vice</i> will show an
              alert when aircraft owned by a controller are outside of their airspace.
            </p>
            <p>
              The airspace object has two members:
            </p>
            <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>

              <tr>
                <td>"boundaries"</td>
                <td>Object</td>
                <td>Defines lateral boundaries of airspace with arrays of location specifiers.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>"volumes"</td>
                <td>Object</td>
                <td>Defines a volume of space using one or more boundary specifiers and a range of altitudes.</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>Each member in "boundaries" names a polyline of one or more line segments.  Polylines are specified by arrays of locations.
              The first and second points specify the first line, the second and third points specify the second line, and so forth.
              Here is an example from the KPHL airspace:
              </p>
<pre>
  "PHL_DQO27_33": [
    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977",
    "N039.25.56.240,W075.29.47.255",
    "N039.26.20.204,W075.27.28.196",
    "N039.22.24.699,W075.26.48.535",
    "N039.21.58.949,W075.28.55.977"
  ]
</pre>
            <p>Note that the first point and the last point are at the same location and thus, "PHL_DQO27_33" is a closed polygon.
              Airspace boundaries do not have to be polygons like this; because boundaries are generally shared between different
              volumes of airspace, it's often useful to define boundaries just as polylines and to assemble multiple boundaries
              to define the lateral extent of a volume of airspace.
            </p>
            <p>Given the boundaries, "volumes" specifies full 3D volumes of airspace.  Airspace volumes have the following members:</p>

		    <li>"arrival_acquisition": when an arrival enters this filter region, its flight plan
                      associates (if available), even if it is still controlled by an external controller
                      and a handoff hasn't been initiated.</li>
		    <li>"arrival_drop": when an arrival enters one of the specified filters, their flight
                      plan disassociates from the aircraft and is deleted. A default volume 3f 2nm radius up to 500' AGL
                      around each arrival airport is generated if no filters are specified.</li>
		    <li>"departure_acquisition": when a departure exits one of the filter volumes, STARS attempts
                      to find the flight plan corresponding to the beacon code the aircraft is squawking.
                      The default volumes are 3nm circles from ground level to 500' AGL around the airport.</li>
                    <li>"inhibit_ca": collision alerts are disabled for aircraft within the filter's volume.
                      These are especially useful around airports so that alerts aren't issued for aircraft
                      arriving/departing on parallel runways, for example.
                      If not specified, a default volume of a circle with a 5nm radius going up to 3,000' AGL
                      around each airport is used.</li>
                    <li>"inhibit_msaw": minimum safe altitude warnings (MSAW) are disabled for aircraft
                      within the filter's volume. Like "inhibit_ca", this is also useful around airports and
                      a volume of a 5nm radius circle going up to 3,000' AGL around each airport is used
                      if none are specified. </li>

                      rather than the partial datablock for tracks in the filter region.</li>

                      by a controller outside of the TRACON, and was previously controlled by a controller
                      inside the current TRACON, its flight plan disassociates and is deleted.

                      a TRACON.)

                    specified for a circular area, "circle_center" will be used for it.</li>
                  </ul>
                  For polygonal areas, there are three additional parameters:
                  <ul>
                    <li>"vertices" (string): the locations of the vertices of the polygon. At least two locations must be
                    given for open regions and three for closed regions.</li>
                    <li>"closed" (Boolean, <i>optional</i>): indicates whether the region is closed (i.e., the last vertex is connected
                    to the first.)</li>
                    <li>"shade_region" (Boolean, <i>optional</i>): indicates whether the region's interior should be shaded.

            <h3 id="fe-stars-filters">Filter Regions</h3>

            <p>STARS uses <emph>filter regions</emph> to manage a number of behaviors that are enabled or disabled
              depending on whether an aircraft's track is within particular volumes of space.
              These regions are defined under "filters" in the <a href="#fe-stars-videomaps">stars_config</a> object.
              As an example, the "inhibit_ca" filter is used to disable collision alerts
              close to airports so that spurious alerts aren't issued between departing and arriving aircraft.
              The lateral extent of filter volumes volumes can be defined either with a polygon or a circle and their
              vertical extent is given by a single range of altitudes.
              The following volume object is used to specify them.
            </p>
            <p>Four members are used for both types of filters:
            <ul>
              <li>"id": a short string (no more than 7 characters) used to identify the volume.
                "id"s must be provided for all filter regions and must be unique among the filter
                regions of the same type.</li>
              <li>"description": a longer string used to identify the volume in system lists.</li>
              <li>"type": either "circle" or "polygon"</li>
              <li>"floor": number giving the minimum altitude of the volume.</li>
              <li>"ceiling": number giving the maximum altitude of the volume.</li>
            </ul>
            For "circle" volumes, there are two additional members:
            <ul>
              <li>"center": the location of the center of the volume.</li>
              <li>"radius": the radius of the volume, in nautical miles.</li>
            </ul>
            For "polygon" volumes, an additional member specifies its lateral extent:
            <ul>
              <li>"vertices": an array of polygon vertex locations specifying the
                outline of the volume.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            For polygonal filter volumes, the last vertex and the first vertex will automatically be connected;
            it's not necessary to close the polygon yourself.
            </p>


            <h3 id="fe-video-maps">Video Maps</h3>

            <p>Video maps are specified separately from the rest of the configuration since they require fairly large files and are not generally edited by hand.
              Two utilities are available to generate maps for <i>vice</i> from other formats:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>They can be generated from CRC video maps using the <i>crc2vice</i> utility program, which is available from the
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/crc2vice/releases">crc2vice releases</a> page.  See
                its <a href="https://github.com/mmp/crc2vice/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
                file for information about how to use it.</li>
              <li>They can be generated from the FAA's DAT video map file format using <i>dat2vice</i>, which is available from the 
                <a href="https://github.com/mmp/dat2vice/releases">dat2vice releases</a> page.  See
                its <a href="https://github.com/mmp/dat2vice/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for more information.
